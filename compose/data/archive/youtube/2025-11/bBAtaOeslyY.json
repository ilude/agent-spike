I can roll it out as a manager to my sales team or my engineering team or my product team and I'm done and we can move on and it's just it's a oneanddone thing. AI is on an exponential curve. This is a case of getting onto a moving train. You are either going to lean all the way in and you are going to learn fast and you are going to scale up quickly in your skills and keep leaning in or you're going to get left behind. And if you learn two or three lines in a prompt and you think you've got it, you're in the left behind contingent.",

    "description": "What is the deal with OpenAI\u2019s prompt pack for teams? \n200 prompts that are supposed to be grab-n-go for teams. The reality is a lot more complicated, and it has real implications for teams and how organizations adopt AI in 2025 (and 2026).\n\nIn this video, I share the inside scoop on why prompt education must match the pace of LLMs and real work:\n\u2022 Why one-line prompts trap teams in AI\u2019s messy middle\n\u2022 How to ground prompt engineering in real workflow pain\n\u2022 What hands-on work showed about GPT-5 vs Claude\n\u2022 Where managers should start: use cases, tool use, upskilling\n\nTeams that treat LLMs as workflow engines\u2014not search\u2014will move faster, but shallow training will leave them behind.\n\nSubscribe for daily AI strategy and news.\nFor deeper playbooks and analysis: https://natesnewsletter.substack.com/",
