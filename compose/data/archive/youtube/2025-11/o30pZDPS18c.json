  "raw_transcript": "So, is Sam right? Are we in a bubble? I would actually argue that if he means, are there elements of unfounded hype in AI? Yes, there are. Absolutely. Is there froth? Yes. As a wonderful example, again, just from this week, I could pick any number of a dozen examples. But look at the number of lovable copycats out there. How many companies do you know who have put up a little box saying, \"What do you want to build today?\" The latest one is Air Table. I would not I would not think that Air Table should be doing that, but they've decided to. With any gold rush, you get people rushing in to stake a claim where they think there's gold. And Lovable has demonstrated there's gold in vibe coding. And so now there's a rush there, right? And there's going to be a lot of me too players. Anytime you have value, you have me too players. That doesn't mean it's inherently a bubble no matter what. And I think that people sort of overindexed on that comment and they thought, \"Oh, there's hype players. That means it's a bubble.",

    "description": "My site: https://natebjones.com\nMy substack: https://natesnewsletter.substack.com/\nThe story: https://open.substack.com/pub/natesnewsletter/p/ai-bubble-why-the-doom-narrative?r=1z4sm5&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&showWelcomeOnShare=true\n\nTakeaways\n 1. Narrative Swings Drive Bubble Talk: A mix of hype disappointment (GPT-5 rollout), layoffs, and Sam Altman\u2019s \u201cbubble\u201d comment created the perfect conditions for a doom narrative.\n 2. Chatbot Plateau: The chat interface is reaching saturation\u2014further model improvements won\u2019t feel as dramatic to end users.\n 3. Progress Shifts to Agentic Use Cases: Real breakthroughs are happening in complex workflows and proofs, but these are harder to grasp than chatbot gains.\n 4. Benchmarks Show Exponential Gains: Non-saturated benchmarks like METR still demonstrate accelerating AI capability growth.\n 5. Chip Scarcity Reflects Demand: Both OpenAI and Anthropic admit they\u2019re under-allocated on chips, showing strong underlying demand, not weakness.\n 6. Restructuring = Refocusing: Meta\u2019s layoffs are less about retreat than reorganizing around inference and next-stage gains.\n 7. Power Law Dynamics: AI investment and returns follow power laws, rewarding outsized bets and forcing firms to specialize in their niches.\n\nQuotes\n\u201cWe are in a world where model makers are showing exponential gains in model performance and we are very early in seeing how that lands with business.\u201d\n\u201cIf it really was a bubble, we wouldn\u2019t all be complaining about it\u2014instead, we would all be hyping it up.\u201d\n\u201cWith any gold rush you get people rushing in to stake a claim, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s inherently a bubble.\u201d\n\nSummary\nThe current AI \u201cbubble\u201d narrative is driven by hype swings, layoffs, and public comments, but the reality is more nuanced. While chatbots are plateauing, progress continues in harder-to-see agentic use cases. Benchmarks show exponential gains, demand for chips is still outstripping supply, and corporate restructurings signal refocus rather than retreat. AI adoption is a power law game: most projects fail, but the successes deliver existential 10x returns, making heavy investment rational. Far from an AI winter, we are entering a phase where the biggest value will come from specialized, high-impact business use cases beyond chat.\n\nKeywords\nAI bubble, GPT-5, Sam Altman, MIT study, enterprise AI, agentic use cases, Meta layoffs, chip scarcity, exponential benchmarks, METR, power law dynamics, AI investment, Anthropic, OpenAI, business AI adoption, AI winter",
