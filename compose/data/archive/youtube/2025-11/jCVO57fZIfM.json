  "raw_transcript": "what's up Engineers Indie Dev Dan here we have an actionpack video today GPT 4.5 was released and uh moving on from that no gb2 4.5 is an amazing model unfortunately it's insanely expensive to use through the API it's only really usable for chat GPT Pro members but of course we need to focus in on the most important release potentially of the entire year Claude 3.7 Sonet and Claude code not only did anthropic release the absolute best base model they released a Hybrid Base reasoning model with thinking capabilities embedded inside of the model they've effectively released two models in one and not only not only did they release a twoin one model they also released Claude code you've likely been using this if you're a fan of the Indy de Dan Channel you know how important air coding assistants are you know how important agents are this is an absolute crash out release okay I'm I'm telling you guys when I saw this when I read through this I started to lose my mind in this video we're going to Showcase several examples of how powerful this can be and of course we're going to use cloud code now we're going to break this down because uh this release changes things the most important image here it's this one agentic tool use the accuracy to be able to call the right tool at the right time is very very very important for the agentic future that we're moving into for building out effective powerful agents as we've been discussing on the channel over the previous few videos one more thing I want to point out before we jump in I am kind of mind blown that they called this 3.7 the first thing I thought when I saw Cloud 3.7 3.7 Sonet is holy crap how far ahead are they inside the lab they they bumped soned up only two points and they gave it reasoning capabilities and it's the state-of-the-art based model now and they kept the price the same this is absolutely incredible uh let's dive into it what are we talking about today uh what's the idea for today's video how can we you know make sense of this and get value and all these incredible tools don't matter at all if we can't understand them build them and use them in our tooling and our developer workflows and then deploy them against real problems to actually create value okay let's be super clear and really honest about you know a lot of the tech ecosystem there are shells among shells of content creators and digital media idea pushers that don't actually use this technology and build with it I hope you can tell we actually build here on the channel if you've seen more than two of my videos you know that that's the case I always try to take everything we're getting of this incredible generative AI technology and I always aim to create useful packages of information and ideas and patterns and principles and I try to you know hand them to you as much as I can every week here every single Monday so this week you know I have something that I think will be really helpful I have the clog 3.7 Sonet starter pack so inside of the starter pack you basically have everything you need to understand every one of the key capabilities of this model so that's what we're going to work through today this is going to be linked in the description for you this is my current model ranking and I'm super curious to see what you think about this leave a comment down below what do you think the current model ranking is in terms of raw power and intelligence uh despite any costs I completely forgot to add 01 in here that's going to be pretty high ranking too let's dive in let's break down the new 3.7 Sonet Hybrid Base plus reasoning model and let's talk about clog code so let's go ahead and open up the Claude 3.7 Sonet starter pack we got to talk about the model stats 200k in 8k out as you'll see in this video you can extend the output token to 128k this is pretty crazy and then of course even crazier we have 64k thinking tokens that we can allocate we're effectively turning on and off our raising model capability with 3.7 on it at at will okay so we're doing this whenever we want we have one of the most up-to-date models by far you know November 2024 fantastic pricing um effectively no changes and they've boosted the capabilities I think they kind of learned a hard lesson from um releasing ha coup U at that frankly really terrible price we're going to dive into my uh extended thinking intelligence guide here's kind of how I'm framing where to set your thinking budget when you're using the uh intelligence model basically there's almost no reason to use any one of these high settings unless you're solving incredibly difficult challenging problems okay um but we're going to get into that in a second let's just go ahead and fire up some examples all right so we're going to start from the most simplest we're just going to recap the simple examples and then we'll move into some of the uh High hitting examples and you know what actually scratch that um I'm too amped on this stuff we're just going to hop right into prompt with extended thinking I'm going to copy this I'm going to open up this file and at the top of every one of these files here you're going to see Clean and Clear instructions on how exactly to use every single one of these scripts these are powerful single file UV scripts we've talked about this in previous videos this is a fantastic way to isolate code it's a great way to run proof of Concepts and it's a great way to run as we talked about in our previous video single file agents moving on let's go ahead and copy this and let's just paste this in and fire it off so you can see here right away with the parameters here we're setting both a thinking budget and a Max tokens now so let's Ry this off and let's check out the output so I've got this all formatted here for you so we have the request to Claud explain Quantum Computing to me all right and then we have some a thinking budget right so we're setting the minimum thinking budget 1,24 tokens so this is the raw API response coming back from Claude and you can see here we have a different type of structure than we're used to right we have not just the response block but we also have a thinking block all right so there's the signature of the thinking block which is just a hash and then we have the actual thinking tokens right so now this is visible to us so you can see it you know just working through the examples it's kind of setting up its response and then finally it's responding and if we scroll down here you can see here right that classic reasoning setup we have thinking tokens first and then we have the actual response afterward at the bottom of every one of these scripts I've added the token summary for you so that you can just kind of quickly see what the cost looks like right so we have inut tokens output tokens and now we have thinking tokens that we can push up and down based on our use case so if we look at the script for a moment here you can see we have our parameters that we can play with an important thing to note the minimum thinking budget is 1,24 tokens so if you need the reasoning model this is the minimum value you should set classic Model set up here nothing special happening but you can see this is the new uh input structure for enabling thinking mode you specify this thinking parameter and then you say enabled and then you specify what your budget is right so this is the budget tokens so very cool and then nothing special happening down here we're just outputting the result and formatting really powerful really simple right at kind of a great simple API let's go ahead and look at the prompt extended thinking with stream so let's go ahead and push into the actual value that reasoning models give us they enable you to solve hard problems where the model always benefits from having time to think just like you or I solving a hard problem thinking through a complex scenario I really love that simple example right if someone asks you a question uh that's challenging or difficult you don't just blurred out the first thing that you think of right um some of us do so when you're confronted with a hard problem you sit and you think right that's what these thinking budget tokens give us here's a whole list of actual reasoning problems that you can work through here that you can you know look at the answers are right above it so let's go ahead and just copy this one and let's let this rip we have 2,000 token thinking budget this is a simple math problem and this is a cool streaming example okay so this is a prompt with extended thinking with streaming let me go ahead and run that again so I'm going to paste this again and then check this out so we have the prompt tokens and then you can see the ANS are getting streamed in here right so we can see the live thinking process of our model and now here's the response bam and there's the output let's go ahead and check check it against the actual answer 48924 that's the exact correct answer right so this is really cool right we have both the final answer but we can also see how our model got there and you can see this one actually took up some thinking tokens this was actually a math problem that required some real thought from the model so you can see here the output tokens was just 60 but it took 232 tokens to actually think through the answer and give you a solid response so to be 100% clear this is what you know these powerful reasing models are all about and now you have full control over the scale of intelligence of the model with the thinking budget tokens let's just go ahead and run another one this is a simple you know uh logical puzzle a says that b is lying B says that c is lying C says that A and B are both line who is telling the truth right so we can give Claude 3.7 some time to think here and we can see that thinking getting streamed in you know really working through this problem with 2,000 tokens and now we have the answer so now it's formatting the actual output for us bam therefore B is the only one telling the truth and you know I've worked through this problem um B is telling the truth so this is the correct answer really powerful really capable and you can see here again I I I just love the visibility here and I love the fact that we can peer into the model and you know this is something that anthropic mentioned is going to be really important for model safety moving forward and I think it's just a great approach for that right when you can see the model thinking it's a lot easier to understand how it's deriving the actual answer for you right so this is awesome uh I think you can kind of get a good idea of the primary capabilities of the extended thinking let's go ahead and continue working through some examples but let's fire up plug first if we clear the terminal and just type CLA you can see here I have two mCP servers connected we'll talk about these in a moment but let's just at a high level really discuss what this is okay what is CLA code really um anthropic explicitly mentions this a couple times if we just search agent you can see this keyword coming up um a couple times okay this is a very very important keyword and paradigm shift that's happening right now we're moving up the abstraction chain of generative AI as we've talked about in many previous V videos over the course of the past 2 years you start with the prompt then you move to the prompt chain prompt chains are also known as these agentic workflows or graphs but then the next step is give the agent the tool it needs give it a powerful model tell it how to solve your problem and then let it run off and actually solve the problem for you to be super super clear what is cloud code Cloud code is an AI agent this is pure genius from anthropic a research preview developer tool where we pay for their model send them our prompts so that they can improve uh the tool and their model I have upped my token usage maybe I'll throw a photo on the screen 100 fold using the new uh CLA 3.7 model in agents and in the new Cloud code what what can we do with this tool I just want to run a couple commands that showcase uh what this thing can really do you know we had some examples here right some puzzle examples Cloud code obviously it can write code you you're going to see 100 videos on cloud code writing code we'll dive into that a little bit more later I want to stress how important it is that this is an agent so we can do agentic things right it has several tools available list files respect get ignore now cloud is thinking and it's going to use one of several tools available to it it's not using traditional LS it's using git LS files okay so I'm going to hit yes this model called The Bash tool let's run something else update and I'm going to uh use a hotkey I I strongly strongly recommend that you set up this hotkey for me it's command shift R now I have the relative path to this file so I'm going to paste this in and I'm going to say update this file add a usage example all right so CLA code kicking off it's running a read tool there was The Bash tool now we're running the read tool it's reading this entire file right I think that's the entire file yep 253 lines it's thinking it's working through this it's understanding what it needs to do and then in a moment here it's going to call the update tool okay update tool requires the file path and it also is going to have you know whatever it's it's actually going to update with right so you can see here here's another example it's a little too heavy for me so I'm going to say uh just going to tap Escape just add the UV run what is the dot dot dot to the usage examples nothing else as incredible as this tool is it's still going to make mistakes right so there we go so I had to be more specific with my prompt there and do you want me to make this edit yes so this is really cool right you can go into YOLO mode or you can run one by one all right so I'm going to hit yes and then you can see there uh it ran update file with that change I just want to really emphasize this point we have update we have read we have bash this is an agent this is an AI agent it has a suite of tools a really powerful prompt right a powerful comprehensive prompt as you likely know you can connect to model context provider server if we just go ahead and clear and rerun you can see there I have these two servers connected let's hop into our server fetch example so this file showcases how you can add an mCP server directly to CLA code I I've already run this so basically you run Claude mCP add Fetch and then you specify the clii arguments that you would need to run this we're using UV so that we don't have to do any setup and then you can run Claud mCP list if you open up a new terminal here and run this you can see I have those two servers set up and you can see the exact commands right so we're going to run my local mCP server in a moment here let's just go ahead and run this you know simple fetch example copy one of these examples and I'm being super lowlevel here with this prompt uh I can you know be a lot looser with it you can see there it's calling the fetch tool and there's the response fantastic let's go ahead and pull from the principal a coding page and list the names of the lessons and descriptions of every single lesson so let's copy this paste this and let's watch Cloud code get to work so again it's calling that fetch tool the tool has pagination built in it's going to you know get the next end pages so that we don't get too much back in one shot but you can see this right here right um these are all the names hello AI coding world the your idks spec base a coding let the code write itself so on and so forth it's doing a great job here it used that tool and it processed everything exactly the way we needed it to uh very very quickly and again I I'm going to sound like a broken record but it just called a tool these are tools that the agent has access to and can properly call this is why in the beginning I mentioned that this is the most important Benchmark chart here okay it's it's the agentic tool use I don't think it's truly understood currently how important this Benchmark is you need to be able to call the right tool when you need it for powerful agentic tools applications and to build powerful agents you need precise tool calling this is great uh we can do uh even more with this right so we can do the same thing is an agent so just you can just ask itself back to back to back so we're going to do the exact same thing and then we're saying then write these to a markdown file all right so just a couple more examples here I just want to you know really nail this point home searching through the page thanks to this tool it's making multiple tool calls to fetch and then at the end it's going to there we go it's going to run the uh right tool okay right tool right you can see file path uh let's go ahead and say uh yes normally I run this in Yolo mode and it just kind of you know does all the work for me we can type GS this is get status and you can see that new file created there let's open that up here's all the lesson names and the description okay so all I want to do here is dial in the point the idea that this is an AI agent with a slew of tools that you can call in any order as long as you're prompt communicates that to the agent and and and you know if you're using this tool you understand that you're working through that but this is just such an important Point why because claw code is just a single agent all right it's it's one agent they're going to be many many many more agents and you as an engineer um Can Build and harness the capabilities of these agents the the really key important part is that you understand that these agents are a series of tools powered by a great prompt fueled by a great language model and this is part of why this release is so great Claude 3.7 is exceptional at calling the right tool when you need it super impressed with the coding capabilities of claw code we'll dive a lot more into actually using this tool you know there's a lot of chatter right now you know does this replace cursor AER Devon in their release they explicitly mention you know cursor mentioned Claude uh cognition right so Devon far better than any other model at planning code changes and handling full stack updates right basically what they're saying here what everyone is saying is that this model Powers my agents very well all right and and then of course you know uh it's great at coding too right it's kind of expected this is the you know Claude 3.5 son it was the best-in-class base model for coding 3.7 takes it to the next level and again I'm I'm I'm super super mind blown that they only gave us two points here right they only incremented the minor version here by 2 points 3.7 what else do they have in the bag so let's go ahead and run my local mCP server all this is going to do is just call a weather endpoint but this really showcases how uh quickly you can set up a mCP server when you have the right tooling so basically you just run this and then you fire up cloud and of course make sure you have UV installed let's go ahead and open up CLA and you can see here we have this local weather mCP now we can reference and just call our weather tools we can just copy this one what is the weather in Germany right now just go and fire that off and you can see there my tool is getting called right my uh mCP server get forecast passing in the parameter Germany all right so that's getting called 37 partly cloudy wow high humidity there right all right so great call it again and again and again right it's an agent just push it push the compute right so now it's going to make three tool calls Bam Bam Bam Germany Chicago San Fran very nice all right push it even further get the weather in all of these places output it to a markdown file right so copy paste same deal push the capabilities push the agent see what it can really really do right I can almost guarantee you you're not pushing this agent far enough you're not pushing agents far enough especially when it's powered by this incredible clae 3.7 Sonet look at this so you know pulled the weather it's calling the create tool right and of course we're going to hit yes now it's Sav GS get status we now have that new weather file open that up format it nice breakdown of the weather right single prompt firing off what was that six tool and you know that's the kind of key idea here I know I'm being repetitive this hasn't been made clear enough the actual Innovation that's happening here CLA code is incredible because it is putting together the model that can call the series of tools to get the job you want done completed right that's that's the real Innovation here it's the model it's the framework of mCP and it's a great Showcase of those things coming out of claw code right and of course you know some of the obvious commands here we can hit slash cost looks like it's modeled very closely after ader and you know other great terminal based tools let's go ahead and push it even further here's a fun one right warmest to coolest list of temperatures in the capital of all these countries and then output to warmest coldest Capitals in a markdown table right so all right so you can see here Washington DC unknown unknown unknown and now it's trying again now it's doing something really really cool it's firing off a Tas TK I don't know if there's a lot of documentation on the task tool let's go ah and see yeah so there's not really any documentation on the on the task tool but the task tool in itself is really really interesting you can see here it's fired off you know it missed Miss missed and then it created this task so this agent is kind of passing off work to a sub agent very very important idea there for agent orchestration and context management then we got a bunch of additional weather calls and then we got the create and now we can fire this off you can see that that is coming in sorted and once again we can just click open this file format and you can see there we have capital country temperature top to bottom the agent is doing a series a chain a you know a job set of work for us and we are typing in natural language we're making sure that our prompt is communicating what we want and we're moving more toward prompting something like this is a lot different than prompting a crap of code so you don't really need the mid lowl prompt details that we discuss in principal ad coding but you can see here just with the right details with the right amount of information we have you know 10 tool calls happening right and it's all about that information density in your prompt are you communicating the right ideas to your agent to get the job done so incredible stuff there uh that's the local mCP server again all this stuff is going to be linked in the description for you to check out uh really dive in and understand how this is set up and how you can build your own mCP servers how you can reuse existing mCP servers there are quite a few mCP servers that you can you know get and use just right out of the box right all the ones you would expect SQL light right we have uh post grass and we have tons of third party uh tools so you know it really is looking like anthropic with CLA code they are Paving the away in this next age in this next kind of phase of generative AI where what you really want is to be plugged up to all the right agent tools right and then you want a powerful model that can guide your agent so that it's always calling the right series The Right steps the right flows of tools with the right parameters really really big idea here you know once again on the channel we're right on track agents agents agents check out the previous few videos where we talk about about agents prompt with extended thinking and Tool use just going to go ahead and copy this open up this file scroll to the top as I mentioned there's going to be complete examples in every one of these scripts you can just copy and fire off ourselves I'm just going to paste this in and you can see here we have a couple of tools right so now we have two tools and what's going to happen here is that claw 3.7 is going to run the right tool based on our prompt right so you can see here prompt what's the weather in Minneapolis what should I wear and then we're giving it a little bit of thinking budget right the minimum thinking budget a little bit of thinking helps the model it really doesn't need to think here just as an example you can see exactly what's happening here all right and so we're thinking through there's the output and it's calling those tools right tool use request location Minneapolis great there's a response and then we have the uh another tool use request get clothing recommendation and this in itself is just another prompt that's running and it is returning this right I recommend wearing a you know medium weight jacket blah blah blah so just a simple example that you can work through to understand how you can call tools with claw let's go ahead and continue pushing here let's look at the biggest you know most heavy-hitting example we can prompt with extended output and extended thinking and streaming let's go ahead and just uh look at what's happening here another great part about claw 3.7 Sonet is that it is very precise and it truly follows your instructions so when we say something like this generate a 10,000w comprehensive analysis on Renewable Energy Technologies we set a high Max tokens and then we set thinking budget okay and then I'm enabling extended output right uh 13k tokens out this is going to go um above the 8K output that uh Claude has here right so we need to boost this up to a potential 100 28k out uh so we can copy this and py this off this is going to be really cool so here it is here's our live you know stream right our live stream of the thinking process you can see Claude thinking and now it has the answer and now it's just going to run through these tokens all right so what did we ask for here we said 10,000 words so you can see there you know 500 this is going to just keep ticking up it's scrolling out of view here uh so we're we're just going to wait for the the uh response words to come in here but this is pretty incredible right we're getting um insane model instruction following again we have other examples here be careful when you fire these off this will you know hit the API and likely you know consume the tokens it takes to respond with the prompt right the extended output token flag really enables you to to push the output of the model far beyond you know any model we've really seen before so you can see here it's still pushing right 3K tokens you can see it's about 10% of the uh total available token usage that's great you can see it only used you know 300 tokens to think far below the thinking budget we gave it of what do we give it here uh 8,000 yeah just this is not a reasoning problem to solve right so we could have easily dropped this down to 1K while this is running you know let me give you my quick guide here on intelligence right how much intelligence do you really need to solve any problem a big takeaway here is that we now have fine grain control over the reasoning capabilities of this powerful model so this is the way I like to slice it up basically we have extra small intelligence all the way up to 4 XL you basically will never need this you you basically will never need to push the model this far this hard uh it is a lot more likely that you'll push into these ranges you know given that you're solving an interesting enough problem where the model actually needs to think as anthropic mentioned I found this to be really useful basically you just start with the bare minimum and you know track your token usage as we are here if you never hit the 1K Mark you never need to go to 2K all right so this is really cool so we just finished and you can see here um our output tokens chewed up you know 6K right so we really really pushed it we really got that uh wow look at look at that up you can really see that this model pushed uh really hard here my word calculation is likely off we're likely not counting it likely got a lot closer here than than we think when you're really pushing the out tokens this is when you're going to boost up uh the cost so this is really powerful right so this is an example of using both the uh streaming with the extended 128k token output and we can just goe and search this so you can see exactly what that looks like right so if we hop down here you can see we're enabling that beta flag to enable these longer outputs this is going to be in the description for you to hop in and play with so you can really understand the capabilities you can also just you know give this to a model give this to your a coding assistant and have generate whatever uh you're looking for so last thing I want to show off here is an agent you can be building your own agents to solve your domain specific problem right now and I'm kind of giving you the a quick start here with the single file agent showcasing how exactly you can do this so before the cloud code release we built a um bash and editor agent on top of claud's bash and editor tools and what we can do is this so we're going to copy this and and run this agent here so agent Loop 1 out of 10 it has 10 compute uses I asked it to do this right the user asked me to create a file called hello.txt with the content hello world inside it I can use the create file tool to accomplish this task it sees the parameters of that tool right so you can see the tool call right here reasoning path and file text you can see the thinking budget right the thinking tokens um walking through what it needs to do to call the tool you can see there's the tool call and then there's the file created response right so this is what that response looks like you can see we have the response raw text and then we have the actual tool use that's all the agent needed to do here right so it's now calling the complete task tool letting me know that it is done just like Claude code here we have an agent that has a series of tools and if we just look at tools we can see here that we have you know a nice slew of tools here this agent has a view file tool it has a create file tool it has string replace insert line so on and so forth here we have our own kind of you know mini version of cloud code and the idea here again is the is the same you can build powerful agents that can help you solve your domain specific problem by giving it the right tools that you would need to solve the problem and by fueling it with a powerful model like clog 3.7 sonin if we scroll to the top and we run this prompt here you can see duplicate whatever text is in hello.txt 10 times on new lines then create a markdown file Json file Ando file with the same content in the format for that file type and you can see I'm upping the compute budget and I'm also giving it 2K thinking tokens okay so I'll copy this clear and fire this off we do have that you know hello world text right here so we can open that up you can see that and now it's walking through the process right so it's calling view5 it's calling string replace it's calling create file right it's creating the markdown file now it's creating that Json file you can see it's calling the create file tool over and over and now it's done okay so so you know this is really cool right we have our own bash file agent operating for us right completing arbitrary tasks because we've given it the right set of tools the right prompt and a powerful enough model clog 3.7 Sonet to accomplish the job and call the right tool this is why tool calling is so important this is why Claude 3.7 Sonet is an absolute crash out critical release okay it just gives you everything you need to not only you know create great prompts great prompt chains but also to take the next step in the composition of generative AI to the next step to agents okay when you think of agents this is what you should be really thinking about it's this this this composition of tools and the right prompt and a good enough model to understand what you want done and you know this this is this is the agent right this is the agent okay so um I know I'm I'm repeating myself over and over it's just you really have to uh kind of nail The Point again and again to really understand how important this is and you can see at the end here our powerful model um you know our hybrid Reasoner base model is calling complete task because it knows that it's done right it it fully is aware that it's completed the prompt we asked it to complete okay and you can see it did it how much compute did that take so it took six compute Loops all right so that's great if we run uh GS or get status you can see here look at all these files it created right uh look at how much work it can do obviously I know simple examples but you can see the power of the tool calling capabilities of the agent with the model right so we can go open this up hello. Json look at that uh hello. markdown check that out hello. yaml perfect yaml format and uh you know we have our other files here generated by our other agents generated by CLA code um I hope you can kind of see where things are going I hope you can see why this is so important this is just a such an important release lots of details here documentation all here for you uh check it out get yourself ramped up super quickly with this code base and understand the capabilities of this model this is a very very powerful model and um you know again let me know what you think about my ranking when we zoom out and take a look at the bigger picture you know it can be really easy to fixate on a single day or a single release but every once in a while there's a release that that really moves things forward and anthropic is really becoming that brand name of uh when anthropic moves when they think when they say something it's very very important to pay attention because it's it's what they're saying on the blog but it's exactly what they're saying and what they're showing that really matters lot of really fantastic stuff here when we when we zoom out a little bit when we look at the larger Trend what does the release of claw 3.7 Sonet mean for us engineers and what does Claud code mean it means exactly as I've been saying as I've been predicting and and communicating capable agents are here they're getting rolled out and the people the engineers the builders that have them are taking that next step they're getting that next level of asymmetric Returns on their time by using agents when you combine it with a powerful Next Generation hybrid model right base plus reasoning rolled into one what we can do and the systems that can be built it's not clear what we can do with these tools now it's not clear what one single agent can do the only thing that's clear is that agents are here and you can now take your compute to a new level there's now a framework and a you know set of infrastructure you can use inside of your tools embedded inside of the agent architecture to take your compute usage to the next level and as I've been saying on the channel there is a causal relationship between your compute usage and the amount of value you can create as an engineer and as a builder now here's the question that you can keep asking yourself to propel yourself forward do you have the right agent connected to the right tool to solve the problems you're facing if you made it to the end and you found my take valuable if you found the information valuable hit the like leave a comment subscribe stay focused and keep building",
