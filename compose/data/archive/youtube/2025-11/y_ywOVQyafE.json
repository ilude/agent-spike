  "raw_transcript": "01 is finally available through the API this means you can use your favorite AI tools to get massive amounts of work done and it means you can prepare for what's next 03 mini and 03 if these benchmarks are anywhere close to True 03 is going to give us capabilities far beyond 01 but until O3 drops 0 one's capabilities are the state-ofthe-art if you want to understand what's possible possible with generative AI 01 can tell you very few engineers and Builders are using the 01 model to its full capabilities myself included and there's a reason for that but if we want to know what we'll be able to do with 03 we need to put some reps in using the current state-of-the-art reasoning model let's practice by limit testing the 01 model against massive AI coding prompts [Music] first boot up your favorite AI coding assistant we're going to boot up AER for Triple C performance that's control customizability and consistency I'm going to run AER with 01 as the architect and let's use deep seek as the editor I'll fire this off and you can see here right away we have 01 in architect mode and then we have deep seek as our editor so what are we coding today we're going to improve Beni a suite of simple benchmarks you can feel we'll talk talk about what this tool is as we work through improvements we're going to ship three new features with three AI coding spec prompts but we'll do this with a Twist let me fire this prompt off and then I'll explain I'll copy it hop back to our terminal all SL load. aer1 this will load our context file for this feature paste this in and run this so what's the twist we're going to ship three new features today but when we complete feature one and two we're going to completely revert the code base back to its original state this way we can see how much we can really do with a powerful reasoning model and most importantly a powerful plan so when we ship feature one we'll revert then we'll ship feature two which will also contain feature one we'll revert again once we test out the feature and then lastly we'll run a 1K token long spec prompt which contains all three features so you can see here our architect 01 is writing this change the editor just completed the change if we close the terminal you can see our change came in for our first feature this is light work for 01 combined with deep seek you can see here we added descriptions light backgrounds to our tools and then we added this kind of fading blue background just to add some more feel to the tool so it's interesting to see the end result before you see the prompt that created it here's an interesting exercise for you can you visualize can you imagine your prompt to get this outcome we added a couple descriptions we added this faded background and we added some light touches to The Styling we add a single prompt with our AI coding assistant running 01 and deep seek do all the heavy lifting Force let's go ahead and take a look at this prompt on the bottom here we have our AER command running 01 in architect and deep seek chat as the editor we're running yes always so that we always approve the suggested changes from the architect we want to skip URL detection and I don't want to commit so that we can roll back these changes whenever we want to you can see we have feature set 1 2 and three and if we look at the token sizes of each we have 275 then we're going to run a 639 token prompt and then finally we're going to scale it up quite a bit and run a 1,600 token prompt I'm really excited to run this last one stick around so you can see that it's quite incredible what you can do with these reeing models um but let's go ahead and start on the first feature so what do we building here how do we actually accomplish this this is a spec prompt this is a specification prompt also known as a plan as you may have noticed with generative AI tools with these incredible models that are coming out the limitation isn't the model anymore the limitation is now our abilities it's our tools and it's our access to the right knowledge that allows us to scale up what we can ask our AI tools agents and assistants to do for us and a big part of that of course is the prompt this is the spec prompt let's go a and just break it down we have a title we have our objective so you can see here we have objective with two subp points we then have our context which is a clear breakdown of the files needed to complete this task we need both the app. viw file and the Styles file available to make this edit then we have a couple of readon files and you'll notice that these context files are exactly what was used if I load up that context fileer 1 you can see that's the exact context I use to load up this AER instance the control and customizability you can get out of using is incredible this is a massive piece of why I use AER so that's the context and then if we look at the low-l tasks this is where we get into our list of prompts a big theme in 2025 is going to be looking for patterns and techniques that you can use to scale up what you can do like I mentioned the limitation is no longer the model with 01 and 03 the limitation is what you can do what are your tools what are your capabilities the spec prompt enables you to scale up what you can do how by creating a list of prompts that's what our low-l tasks are here right and if you've taken principal a coding you know this already so we have a single task with a couple of requests and then details within the requests right so you can see update the app container we're referencing a class so this is a great way to reference front-end locations we then have a couple details on what exactly we're looking for and then we're saying update the nav buttons and of course the nav buttons are the tools themselves so we added some details there and that's our first prompt so you can see here we're being very precise right we're not saying create a new snake game we're not saying you know add a new random tool with real projects you're really always going to be working with existing code so having powerful referencing mechanisms like class names files and by having these consistent keywords that you can use makes it a lot easier to update real production code so this was our first feature right this was our first spec prompt that did all this work for us thanks to the 01 reasing model with a solid editor model and there are variants here just to be super clear you can use Claude you could probably use a GPT 40 model here if you wanted to you can use Gemini Flash and if you're worried about deep seek or the CCP stealing your data um you can also run I have a version here where we have 01 running deep seek from the fireworks API okay so this will of course be inside the Beni code base you have full access to this links going to be in the description so our Focus here is to scale up what we can do and is to understand the capabilities of the 01 model paired with a powerful editor model so as we talked about we're going to roll back these changes so I'll build up a new terminal instance and you can see there are two files that were edited I'm going to run get restore Dot and you can see our changes were fully reverted so now we're going to stack feature one and feature two together right so we're literally going to ship two features in in a single prompt let's copy this open up the terminal we're going to run reset reset is going to clear out every single one of our context files and it's going to reset the chat history so there's no cheating here it has no information about the changes that it just made so it's effectively starting fresh we're then going to run/ load. aer2 this is a great way to customize and control your context files again shout out AER this is the most powerful most controllable AI coding assistant you can get your hands on right now I highly recommend this and in principal AI coding this is the tool we use to teach the principles of AI coding so let's go ahead and fire this off you can see there we loaded the entire context you can load and save context with a single command so let's run/ tokens let's see what our bill is going to be so 17 cents per prompt not too bad but of course you know if you're looking at this and you normally Run Deep seek or claw maybe much higher than you normally used to right you got to pay to play to use the best models so that's that we have our second spec prompt and it's going to run two features for us let's go ahead and paste it run this and then we can break it down just by looking at the top of this you should be able to identify what you want done right and this is how you create powerful spec prompts and communicate the work you want done to your AI coding assistance we have two features we want landing page improvements and we want to add ISO speed bench Awards so this is one of the benchmarking tools and we're adding reward capabilities to this Benchmark so for things like speed time taken and accuracy we want some quick rewards that will help us visualize the work done so let's go ahead and see if our a coding assistant is complete yet you can see here the architect has drafted the changes you can see our W frontend code right here fastest slowest most accurate least accurate and then we have the Perfection model so far so good right our AI coding assistant running 01 and deep seek looks to be writing all the code for us doing all the heavy lifting all we did was properly communicate what we wanted done with a powerful spec prom this is the second maybe third time we're discussing the spec prompt on the channel why is that it's because it's a Ultra Ultra powerful pattern that can get you massive results just by adding more you can ask these models to do more for you if you're using the right tooling so this is a powerful theme on the channel powerful theme in 2025 ask the model to do more and be super clear about what you're asking and how you're asking it right the spec prompt the specification prompt also known as just a plan helps you scale up the work you can pass off to your AI coding assistant and in general your AI tools okay so we can open up the context and you can see you know we have few more files here we have some typing files we have a store file and we have you know another component we have those same readon files we have a new section here implementation notes we're asking 01 and deep seek you know make sure you don't skip everything fulfill every detail and then in our low-level tasks you can see here we're running several prompts if I just collapse the actual work we have three tasks instead of one okay so we're asking our a resistant to do three things let's see if our work's complete looks like it is so let's go ahead and review remember in the age of AI we're becoming cators we're becoming reviewers we're becoming managers of code and information I still have not written a single line of code myself and as you can see here we just had 21,000 tokens generated for us we can see the cost coming out about half a buck the first and second prompt you can likely get away with using a deep seek or CLA 3.5 that won't be the case when we get to our third prompt we'll run in just a moment so let's go ahead and collapse and let's check out the changes right so same kind of deal you can see our first feature was again implemented properly you can see we have a little bit of extra padding but that's fine this is something we can easily tweak and then we have our cards let's go ahead and see if that second feature got completed for us it did so take a look at this right so this is the iso speed benchmarking tool we talked about this tool in a previous video on the channel I'll go ahead and Link that if you're interested in this tool but basically it lets us create these great benchmarks where we can see and compare the results next to each other so if we collapse the header there and reduce the block size you can see we have several models running side by side together and this is just a cool way to kind of visualize how models perform next to each other in a real live way again Beni is all about creating benchmarks you can feel but if we focus on the feature that we just created here you can see something really interesting we have the fastest model but we also have the least accurate and if we scroll down here we can see Quint 2.5 coder it's the slowest model and if we go all the way to the bottom here we have the 54 latest in this Benchmark it's the most accurate and it has the Perfection Award right and of course Perfection is 100% accurate so this is really really cool to see right with this single prompt we were able to implement two features again these are one shot features okay I haven't written a single line of code I've been prompting I've been planning this is a big big theme for 2025 let's go ahead and break this down so by looking at the lowle task just the headers right the highle description of them we can see what we asked for okay Implement gradient background and descriptions update types to contain Awards update ISO speed bench row to compute and display Awards just by looking at the descriptions here we know roughly what the prompt will look like right and as you're building out your specification documents this is a great format to follow the spec template is something that we use a lot in principal ad coding it's so useful in fact that I have a code here that will automatically spit out specification documents for me okay and this is something that I always want to emphasize on the channel um I am an engineer and a product Builder far before I'm a YouTuber none of the stuff is for show I think it's clear for most people watching the channel but there are a couple people that literally think that I you know create these patterns that uh it's like just for show none of this is for show okay you can see here we have the spec and that will output this you know entire template that I you know use quite often frankly every day at this point and uh you know this gets me uh started on a great format for writing these plans right writing these spec prompts okay just real quick we can dive into task two and three since we already know it's in task one we can open this up we can see here we're updating our types updating your types first in the earliest step possible is a key pattern because it lets your AI coding assistant know from that point forward we're going to be working with these types you can see here I'm saying add Awards we are again like I just mentioned we're referencing that type okay this is super important every M of principal a coding you've seen this you know this already you're actually much further ahead than what we can cover here in a single video but you can see here we added a computed property and then we added you know a div to contain these new items right and so that's how these you know show up just by giving our a coning assistant the right information and by using a powerful enough model the power of the 01 model really starts to shine the larger and the more you ask in your prompts so you can see here our contact is getting larger our asks are individual prompts right our list of prompts are also getting larger okay and that leads us to our final large specification document and we're going to do quite a few things here so before we kick this off let's go ahead you know take our code I'll reset under our AER instance right so we reset the chat and we drop all the files so we have a fresh AER instance here reset this we're going to run get restore Dot and you can see in the background we're going to lose this feature so that was fully restored so now we're back where we started right feature one one is gone feature 2 is gone you can see everything's back to the base State now we're ready to run the largest three features in one specification document this prompt is massive it contains three complete features and you can see here we have 1,600 tokens as the prompt that doesn't even count the files so let's go ahead and boot up our AI coding assistant/ load and we have the context in -3 if we enter here you can see this massive load of context to AI code feature 1 two and three okay so let's get this fired off before we look at this I'm going to get this in the queue right this is going to take a bit of time to generate from the architect and then for our Editor to run okay so we're going to copy this and we're going to paste it in here and we're going to run it and then let's go ahead and review okay so we're looking for feature one our descriptions background we're looking for feature two our words for fastest slowest and most accurate and then we're looking for a brand new feature here let's go ahead and open up the multi- autocomplete benchmarking tool you can see here we have a list of models to quickly summarize the feature we're adding here these models are static so they are enums in the codebase right now we need to update them to support any model from several providers okay so that's what we're doing here at a high level there's a lot of code surrounding these existing enum values and that's why we need a ton of contexts and a massive prompt to get that done if we open up our objective and our contexts you can start to see um exactly what we need done so you can see those previous two features are rolled into the objective and we have the third okay so we're updating our multi autocomplete tool to use models as strings with prefixes instead of model aliases and this spec prompt is quite a bit larger if we go ahead and collapse everything here um you know there's a bit more code needed to be done here and we are getting to the edge of what's possible here with the 01 model I brog this into 10 individual tasks there's a lot going on here you know this calls to a really important aspect of writing these prompts at some point something is going to go wrong we are Engineers this is how things work at some point you're going to push your capabilities you're going to push what's possible and then something will go wrong that's okay it's all about having the tooling and the right patterns to quickly get back up and correct the mistakes the great part about using the spec prompt here is that when something goes wrong you can see we're still coding here this is really really fantastic right this entire time our a coding assistant is still writing code for us since we have our plan our specification document in an isolated file it's separated from any AI coding tool any AI agent any AI tooling right this might seem like a small detail but it's super super important why is that why is this important we have detached the outcome the work that we want done from any individual assistant right we have this separate asset that is our plan and now we can deploy it to any number of AI assistants and to be super concrete about it that means that at any point we can boot up another AER assistant it's very likely that we'll have to come in on this third massive specification Dock and set up another ater instance to just clean up some of the work that our powerful architect model did just because there's so much going on here okay and this is something that you know likely in the future 03 and Next Generation base models will be able to handle for us right they'll be able to use you know just a single architect mode just a single shot and get all the changes done for us but you can see here at around you know 1.5k tokens really 1K tokens um that's where I found 01 starts to fall apart for large large code changes again if we open up this context file I mean large right we have what 15 files here okay so let's go ahead let's hop back you can see our code was uh completed we have actually a lot of cash hit here that's kind of good to see but this is over several several runs our aor AI coding assistant had several issues that it worked through here we had a couple lenting issues um you can see here we had 22 search and replace blocks right we're asking for a lot and this is what you want to be doing with these next Generation AI coding tools and most importantly with your great spec prompts and these powerful 01 models Here's the final test right let's see if if these changes actually came through so let's go feature by feature you can see here we have our original feature our a coding assistant added a nice glow effect to our text I like this version the best let's go ahead and click into ISO speed bench we'll use sample data you can see here um it's missing the awards right we asked our AI coding assistant to do a lot it missed this feature okay so like I mentioned this is going to happen the great part is we have a specification document that contains everything we want done in the right order and even more importantly all of these items are referenceable okay so let me show you exactly what I mean so we have a couple options here and let's go ahead and do both of them we'll fall back on the second hop back to the spec prompt and we'll look for the change that's missing we are missing steps two and steps three okay and so I'm just going to come back to our architect it already has all this information in its context window right if we hit SL tokens you can see here our chat history has five ,000 tokens in it already Okay so we're just going to reference what was missing and say you know make sure you add it so we're missing our Awards be sure to add it okay and then I'm just going to paste in those lowl tasks and while this is running I'll show you the alternative option right which is to boot up another AER AI coding assistant so we'll say um sh- and to be clear you know son is 3.5 Sonet and so we have this running this is just a base model running on AER we can type SL load a-3 have a separate context file so we can reuse it across any AER agent and now if we wanted to we could write the change but as you saw in the background here awesomely that change came in okay so you know we have our rewards there and actually really like this version of the awards system we have these like kind of full width bars here and you can see we got that same result right so we can go Ahad and hit play Benchmark we have the fastest overall coming out of L 3.21 billion parameter but also the least accurate right makes sense we scroll down we can see our slowest from coin 2.5 54 latest um and this isn't even the official 54 model we can see here we have most accurate and we have the perfect score award so feature two kind of just one click away and our 01 deep seek model got that correct right but I want to emphasize the point here that by having a pre-planned specification document effectively an asset and and you know I want to make that really clear when you when you plan out all your work what you're doing is you're creating a reusable asset that you can deploy over and over until the job is done right and this is really important 2025 is all about AI agents and on the channel it's all about scaling up what we can do the spec prompt helps us get there if you've taken principal AI coding you know this and you also know what's coming next so this is feature one and feature two okay so let's go ahead and see if we got feature three I'm going to click into this hit reset nice nice nice um you know I'm going to be totally honest here future 3 is massive during future 3 is where uh you know this video could get much longer so it's good to see that that came through we have our model prefixes right so the model prefix tells us what provider to use okay but it's not all perfect it looks like we are missing something I'm expecting a scroll here for some additional models okay go back to this spec prompt and if we scroll down um at some point here yeah so task six I asked for new models so you can see here I'm asking for a decent slew of new models once again I have this reusable app set this plan that already contains all the work right I've thought through everything I want I know what this looks like when it's done right and this is the point you want to get to right this is that senior mindset right it's that senior principal staff engineer mindset think about what you want done don't just open up don't just open up you know don't just boot up your ad coding assistant and start typing right stop think plan and then execute okay you will save so much time and you will do so much more as these models continue to scale up and improve and as you stay subscribed hit the like hit the comment to stay plugged in to this stuff okay I don't know if you've noticed by now but we don't just look at this stuff we don't just talk about hype news on this channel we use this technology in ways that help us get more work done than ever before we're going to copy the sixth prompt here and we're just going to again open up our AER assistant like I mentioned we can make this change in our leader architect AI coding assistant or we we can hop over to a simple Sonet right this will save us a lot of money a lot of time we can just run it here if we want to but I'm going to continue using the state-of-the-art because it already has all the context it already has everything we need right and you can see here we had a 13k token cash hit so the cost did come down quite a bit right if we look at the open AI pricing the cash input tokens is about half the price pretty good the big price of course is the output token right it's hard to get around this right at some point here with these powerful City theart models you got to pay to play open this up and say missing models requested by task number six okay then I'm just going to paste task number six and so while this is running I can show off uh what this can do and maybe we'll find you know additional thing we need to fix here um this is the multi autocomplete Benchmark the purpose of this is to uh see how well models can autocomplete single words right so it's just a quick Benchmark to understand fundamental capabilities of these language models we can see that change got finished so if I hit reset we can see our additional models our power o1 reasoning model and deep seek combination right our model chain our prompt chain is getting a lot of work done for us even though it's missing some details we have this powerful spec doc we can keep referring to we should be able to run this autocomplete I'm just going to type something like calcu okay and so we have an error so let's go ahead and quick see what our error is here on our server Union is not defined this is a super simple fix normally I advise against doing this but I'm just going to hop in here and do this for time sake you Union going to refresh run calue bam and so we can see our models kicking off we have a couple errors on these models if we scroll down we can see a lot of our newer models the o1 preview completed 01 completed and you can see what this prompt is doing right I typed calq and our completion is coming in here with the correct or the incorrect autoc completion option here right uh we get a breakdown of execution time costs and relative costs and number correct right we can up vote down vote to change the uh accuracy and now run arbitrary models right we're not tied to our previous model Alias anymore and we had one error there where we needed to add this Union again this is just a small thing that you have to be ready to come in fix and adjust when you're using these powerful 01 reing models they're they're good but you can see here we're brushing up against the limits our limit testing and our large spec prompts are exposing the true capabilities of these reasoning models our cost for all these sessions came out to two bucks 23 not too bad considering all the work we got done that quickly as you're looking at this you might be wondering where does the time go of course I spent almost all my time here building out the spec prompt specifically the third spec prompt you can see here the first one is really tiny only 200 Tokens The Second One 600 tokens but the last spec prompt I really had to sit think through everything I wanted look through the code make sure that I understood as the Builder as a Creator I understood what I wanted to see so that I could properly package it and hand it off to our AI coding assistant we use the 01 model deep seek and then we boot it up we never actually ended up needing claw 3.5 Sonet as our kind of you know backup Quick Change Model but it was here if we needed it right so super powerful pattern I hope you can see how important all this is you know hit the like hit the sub join the journey although 01 and likely 03 are going to be pay to play models um the capabilities and the things they can offer you is going to be incredible right with 01 and Next Generation models the question is becoming less and less about what the models can do and it's more about what you can do with the models okay that's what we focus on here on the channel and that's why I created principled AI coding if you want to write massive amounts of code with AI coding patterns like the ones we talked about in this video I recommend you check out principled AI coding as you all know by now software engineering is changing it already has changed now the question we have to answer is are we willing to change with it that's what principal a coding is built to help you do principled AI coding is my take on the best way to learn AI coding in the current Tech ecosystem where every day there's a new research paper a new model a new tool claiming to solve all your problems turns out most of it is not useful actionable or material what matters is principles and patterns surrounding AI coding that you can reuse tens hundreds and thousands of times okay in the course I've distilled everything I've learned since gpg 3.5 was first available I've been AI coding since the beginning if you don't believe me you can fact check it by looking back on the YouTube channel over a year ago okay I have put everything I've learned into pure oil so that you can not only stay relevant but Thrive by learning how to use AI coding assistant to do the heavy lifting of engineering for you in 2025 this is the point of no return if you're writing code manually you are starting the self-deprecation process okay and if you're writing code with AI um disguise the limit here right as you just saw thousands of tokens right hundreds of lines of code were generated by knowing how to do it and by focusing on what's most important in this course we focus on principles not tools there are many Engineers watching the channel you have already taken principal AI coding you know how valuable this is uh many of you have left uh you know fantastic reviews huge shout out to all the existing members couple exciting announcements uh we have new updates coming in February it's not exactly what you think I'm not putting out new video content yet but it's going to be really exciting stuff that's going to help you write code with AI faster and better I'm also working on setting up a community for principal AI coding members you can expect that to come out in sometime in Q2 I'm still learning how to manage a community properly and kind of learning all the RPS there so stay tuned for that this is your last chance to get the New Year's limited price deal uh this is 33% off the full price um I think we're going to go up to near if not up to the full price after January ends so if you're interested if you like what you saw in this video there's a lot more of it in principal a coding we focus a lot on the kind of key principles and patterns behind great AI coding and less on the individual tools and models themselves this is a really really important differentiator because the tools and models will continue to change over time right this is why we focus on principles not tools all this stuff will change that's the only guarantee in software engineering things will change what doesn't change is the principles that can guide you throughout this entire process okay one of the key principles we talk about is managing the big three context model and prompt these are the essentials that you need to write great a coding prompts and get a ton of work done in fractions of the time so jump in here start with the beginner lessons go intermediate then Advanced if for whatever reason you don't like what you see or you're not interested or it's just not for you this is specifically for software Engineers you can get a full refund before you start Lesson Four okay I've made this as risk-free as possible for you so if you're interested jump in here get the New Year's deal before it ends and accelerate your engineering where we're writing code with AI assistance where we're packaging and handing off work to our AI tooling to get more work done than ever before with 03 right around the corner it's super important to play with 01 to get some value out of it and to understand what's coming next we're not just paying for top J performance when we use 01 through the API when we you know use 01 Pro mode inside of chat GPT what we're paying for is a glimpse of the future right and we're preparing to push compute even further Beyond with Next Generation Benchmark breaking models like the 03 model we want to be prepared for this when it happens and this is how we do it right we scale up our work with powerful spec prompts with powerful plans on the channel we're focusing a lot more on how can we package and handoff work this is where Ada and the personal AI assistant also come into play right we want to be handing off work to compute that's always on always available for us we want to be utilizing this API we want compute to be doing work for us the prompt is the new fundamental unit of knowledge work and now we need to stick to the the right principles so that we can use the right patterns that allow us to max out our computer and use the most intelligent models to get the most work done how will you even know how to use a model like 03 if you don't even know how to use 01 or even 01 mini food for thought if you don't want to pay that's fine I totally understand the next best thing to do is to stay plugged in to information channels like this one so you at least understand the potential on the channel we're on a mission to max out compute and get massive Roi on our time if that interests you like subscribe
