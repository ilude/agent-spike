  "raw_transcript": "if you can't use it if you can't get value from the thing that you created why would anyone else your first user isn't someone that tries your app and then leaves and never comes back you can see here we're really digging into the things that define success and failure okay so you're an indie developer you have a sweet idea for an application there's only one problem you don't know where to start you came to the right place today i'm going to talk about what to do after you have an idea after watching this short 10 minute video you'll have a better idea of how to take your idea and turn it into a real product today we're going to talk about the solopreneur product proposal i myself am an indie developer and solopreneur working to build up my portfolio of small bets of applications this is a document that i've created over time as i've built out app after app after app the important part about the solopreneur product proposal is that you are filtering out ideas here's the harsh truth every idea does not deserve to be created you shouldn't create every idea that you have in fact there's just not enough time so today i'm gonna break down the solopreneur product proposal that i use to develop all of my projects i'm gonna share it with you to help you on your journey to take your application from idea to reality all right so let's jump in so what is the let me start my timer here so what is the solopreneur product proposal you have to determine if the thing that you're thinking the idea that you have in your head is actually worth the time to build the solopreneur product proposal helps you do that right so it helps you think through you know the important details in a quick way so that you can filter out what you should and what you shouldn't spend the time to build right because when we're talking about software we're talking about weeks months and years possibly of your time uh being poured into an application and you know it can really help to just plan out a couple things to you know fill out this proposal and just see okay you know now that i have everything out on the screen on paper so to speak should i continue with this plan or are there some obvious things that i haven't really thought through right so let's jump in so we're going to cover five key things what and who we're going to cover when we're going to cover how and we're going to reality check ourselves all right and then at the very end we're going to uh jump into things you can do right now to get started and to stop waiting to stop you know delaying right because that's another kind of aspect of building your own product right because you can always wait you can always wait another day right you're working too much or you don't know what you should start with blah blah blah first things first what and who there are three key things that we need to talk about here what are your pillars and we'll get into what exactly that means in a second what's your product and who's your first user uh these three are extremely important that's why they're at the top um definitely uh when you're filling this out you know go ahead and copy this template and fill it out for your own product fill this out top to bottom it's really important to go in order so what are pillars so pillars define the reason you specifically are building this application you can build something for a number of reasons right you can learn you can try to create a revenue source for yourself you can try to you know develop a certain skill right you can work on your animation abilities your design skills whatever it might be right you need to define this before you even start building before you do anything else figure out why you're doing this figure it out for you because when things get hard and you know you're coming up against serious conflict your pillars are going to guide you in the right direction what's next your product um so i'm not gonna jump into every section you guys can copy this and go into more detail yourself everything's all laid out here um first link in the description check it out and dig in a little more um you know i am limited on time i want to cover the high level sections for you guys so that everything makes sense so your product is a thing that solves a problem by providing value for a specific person so when you're defining your product you're going to talk about the problem that you're solving just in one sentence you're going to describe your product again one sentence one image we're not this is not a big breakdown of this massive great idea this is high level um you know we're touching on important concepts in a short concise way right um what's the value that you're providing like what is a concrete value are you providing uh you know are you giving people their time back is this an educational thing is this entertainment right and then how does your product make money right so dig into those sections some more first user this is really important a lot of solopreneurs pretty much anyone starting out makes this mistake i know i made this mistake a lot and i don't anymore partially thanks to this document because it forces me to think about it to find your first user your first user isn't someone that tries your app and then leaves and never comes back your first user is someone who comes back day after day that consistently gets value from using your application right so it's important to uh define what they're like define where they hang out digitally and physically what language do they use what are the keywords that they use right what are types what are the types of questions that your first user asks uh what are the tools and apps that your first user uses right this is all really important because it determines what marketing channels you you'll use to communicate with them right so that's what and who after you finish that we can talk about when there are three things you need to kind of schedule and attempt to predict and plan your personal viable product minimum viable product and your minimum lovable product i want you to come to this document and look at what each of those mean here i want to skip over this section you're going to start with your personally viable product this is the version of the product that you can use and you can get value from it all starts there if you can't use it if you can't get value from the thing that you created why would anyone else all right so that's the when and the how so notice how we haven't talked about technology yet uh honestly it's kind of an afterthought it's important to talk about your priorities so why did you pick this technology and then it is also important to detail what technology you picked i'll let you guys dig into that some more here and then comes distribution so distribution is really really important um again this is a classic you know first time second time third time uh any developer founder mistake we skip over this entire idea of how our app and product will get in front of the eyes of people to even know that it exists right you can have the greatest app in the world that solves everyone's problems right but if no one knows you exist it's almost like your app does not exist either so marketing channels thinking about how the user progresses through your marketing channels into uh from and around your application ecosystem and thinking about feedback loops of how you collect data from your users and by data i mean how you know that your user is getting value out of your application distribution is all about these things dig into this some more there are lots of really important questions uh to answer here for instance marketing channels right so how are you going to share your app right on what platform right there are search engines ads blogging social media right there are tons and tons of ways you know in person meetups um tons of ways to communicate to the world that your product does this thing and solves that problem right um user journey right so user journey is really important basically your user journey is going to describe how user enters your ecosystem and how they navigate through the world that you have created and this world is you know from the beginning when they see your you know ad or they see your blog all the way to when they're using your application right so the full journey your feedback loop is essentially your analytics right how are you learning that your users are using your app correctly and how are your users telling you how they want to use your application right how do you know that you're building the right thing this is your feedback loop okay and next section the reality check the most important thing in the reality check is you have to define the most important thing that needs to be true for your product to be successful this is called the critical hypothesis if this question is false your product will not succeed so you can see here we're really digging into the things that define success and failure okay the reality check also is going to dig in further and ask you several questions about why your product might work and why your product might fail right so the reality check is really important after you've defined your what who when and how reality check is gonna make sure that um you really think about the outcomes that can happen okay so that's it guys 10 minutes is up um i want you guys to grab this document read through all these things go ahead and stop my timer i want you guys to grab this dock fill it out for your next app idea and then check out the get started now where i give you three concrete actions that you can take to start building your application right now so i really appreciate your time i hope that this document helps you if you think that something should be tweaked or if you are already a builder and you've you know built your own application definitely drop a comment i'd love to hear your feedback you know this is a document that can be updated over time so if there are improvements that need to be made certainly we can make them and as i continue to build on my solo premier journey you know i'll be updating this to ask better questions and to think through applications in a more thorough way so i hope that the solopreneur product proposal helps you get started on your application right now today if this video was helpful for you definitely like comment and subscribe i'll see you guys in the next one [Music]
