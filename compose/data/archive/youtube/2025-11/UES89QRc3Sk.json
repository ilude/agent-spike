  "raw_transcript": "what's up Engineers happy New Year let's make some predictions for 2024 these predictions are for everyone but I really want to focus on Advanced AI engineering so we're talking llms we're talking agentic software we're focusing in on the new fundamental unit of Technology The Prompt the llm the Transformer gbts we're going in depth we're making some high conviction predictions here I want to give you Insight on how I'm thinking about the next year here over these topics we're talking about AI llms programming we're talking about big tech stocks job market at the very end I want to share some paral actions you can use to get 80% of all the results with 20% of the input right following the 8020 rules so let's talk about why we make predictions in the first place it might seem really silly every year everyone gets together and decides to you know guess at what's going to happen in the next year it's a little more complicated than that there's a lot more going on great predictions yield greater account accountability when you have greater accountability you have more skin in the game right you have more to lose and when you have more skin in the game you put more effort in right you care more because you know your reputation your status your word is on the line when that's the case you typically are going to put more energy in and you're going to create greater outcomes if you correctly predict the future you can take advantage of being in the right place at the right time before everyone else and even if you're wrong you can learn from your mistake and you can likely pivot into situations that you you know you considered and that you put thought into already because you're making predictions and then you can pivot into that faster and easier as a concrete example imagine that you predict local llms will be on par with GPT 3.5 that means everything GPT 3.5 can do can be done on device locally with some decent PRT engineering if you make that prediction that means you can start getting ahead right you can start putting it into your Tech stack you can start positioning yourself you can start learning how to use the technology that will likely yield that result and so you can be there ready before any anyone else does you can have it integrated in your product and in your work right so this is why we make predictions we make predictions so that we can be more accountable which forces us to have more skin in the game which yields greater outcomes okay so real quick just want to look back in 2023 I made 24 predictions I got 16 of them right that's a 66% win loss rate so pretty good I think if you're above 50% you're going to win over time right just like an investor or a Trader looking at the stock market if you can get over 50% % even just a few percentage points over 50% and you play that out over the long term you're going to win big I think that's a good metric to follow I'm at 66% all over the last year if you want to check out those predictions some of the things I got right some of the things I got wrong Link in the description for that this video is going to focus fully on 2024 predictions I personally try to follow people who are consistently you know not only making new predictions um but are also taking accountability for when they're right and when they're wrong right like show me the proof show me the proof that your predictions are worth listening to at all right when you have people listening to your advice people following you you should show when you're right and when you're wrong so let's move on of course disclaimer these are my personal predictions I make bets on them with my time and my money but that doesn't make them any more right or any more likely than your predictions right your predictions are anyone else's don't blindly follow me don't blindly follow anyone's predictions you will end up getting burned do your own research put the time in think deeply and then make your prediction so let's get into it Ai and llm predictions open AI is going to continue to lead the AI race no one's going to come close everyone simply copies their strategies and attempts to replicate their models by using their models not a huge prediction to make but you can definitely see a world where someone outc competes open AI I don't think this will happen I have strong conviction here open source llms achieve consistent performance at GPT 3.5 turbo levels I really do think that the llm open- source space is going to catch up really quickly it already has been and I'm really excited about this I am actively taking bets on this already in my software with my time building this out into future products Future tools that I'm working on right now I do believe that open source llms are going to achieve 3.5 turbo levels in 2024 so I think we're going to see the first major AI sentience scare and it's going to be reproducible at least for a small amount of time while that model is still out in the open it's going to involve a next generation llm from open Ai and it's going to spark some serious concerns and it's going to elevate the status of prioritizing AI safety I think most of us take this as a joke right now you know to be totally honest myself included I don't think it's a serious problem yet but I think in 2024 we're going to see something that is reproducible that really makes us understand the threat of AI sentience so breaking down my conviction kind of tier list here mid is at the bottom strong is in the middle and extreme is at the top keep in mind these are predictions that I'm actively betting on so even my mid level predictions at the bottom are still things I do believe will happen let's move on more Ai and llm predictions open AI is going to release two groundbreaking models I think they're going to put out their next Generation gbt model and then likely later in the year they're going to put out a Next Generation new architecture that proceeds the Transformer architecture it's going to be whatever's next after GPT I think they're going to launch that in the second half of the year extreme here mastering the art of effective prompt engineering becomes a crucial skill for knowledge workers it builds on top of the fundamentals reading technology coding prompt engineering is the thing that comes next I I think it's going to be a fundamental skill for knowledge workers in 2024 I have strong conviction here I think that the chat interface becomes ubiquitous everyone expects it on nearly every single website um it's going to transform user expectations the chat inter face will become the standard for AI interactions and then contrasting that I think that we're also going to kind of grow tired and realize how lazy uh copy and pasting a chat interface is everywhere and then someone finally and I think this will happen around you know mid 2024 finally someone's going to put out a brand new user interface that makes us rethink how we should be chatting and communicating with our llms it's not going to be a chat interface and I think it's going to spark a variety of creative uis for llms okay let's talk about programming no code low code that smoothly integrate with llms and that have a full optin coding experience become the standard for rapid prototyping is going to set the stage for the best way to build most software here's an extreme conviction prediction I think the next generation of programmers will be divided into two camps those that focus on learning fundamental programming skills and use GPT Tech technology to enhance their learning and then another group that rely on gbt as a shortcut I think from the beginner level all the way up to the senior staff level there are two very different ways to prompt you can prompt things that you know how to do yourself and you can prompt things that you don't know how to do and when you blur the line to the second case of things you don't really know how to do there's very little learning experience unless it's connected somehow to knowledge you already know now imagine this for beginners it's going to be critically important for beginners to use GPT as a learning tool not a problem solving tool specifically when they're getting started probably in their first year so over time the first group will succeed and the second will struggle they're going to become over reliant on their GPT prompting abilities I think effective engineering managers and hiring managers will learn to distinguish between these two who's just really great at prompting and then who's great at prompting but also knows how to write code so if you're a newbie and you're just getting started or maybe you're a junior engineer keep that in mind make sure you're using gbd to learn not just as a shortcut to solve your problem all right more programming predictions I think typescript and python will remain the unchallenged best allaround multi-purpose programming languages you can script you can write web servers you can write desktop applications you can really do it all with these two languages Mastery of these two languages will ensure employability in the tech industry mid-level conviction here Apple Vision Pro is going to pave the way for the Next Generation Computing platform I think this will Mark the beginning of the migration from the laptop to the headset it's going to be a very very slow transition it's bold to say that it's starting now but I'm going to make the bet that this is going to be the beginning piggybacking off that prediction we're going to see a surge in the popularity of the Swift programming language due to the headsets it's going to be a small bump but it'll be a bump another set of programming predictions here Microsoft co-pilot AER mtat cursor and all the other AI assistant that you've heard of become a musthave for all programmers they'll be integrated into all major idees and become a standard part of the programming experience we already see this with Microsoft co-pilot if you're not on Microsoft copilot you are officially falling behind so you need to be using this technology and if you want to get ahead you need to be pushing even further try AER try minat TR cursor there are many other AI assistants we've covered some of them on the channel this is going to be a part of the standard experience so make sure you're at least up to the standard okay extreme conviction here um I think top performing engineers continuously will move up the stack they're going to be spending more of their time on business and product strategy and less on implementation details why how can they do that they utilize great tools powered by AI assistants that automate a majority of their implementation work um I think if you're using chat GPT you're using GPT 4 and you're solving problems you're building actively on a daily basis you've already started to do this and I think we're really going to see top performers Blast Off by doing this senior plus Engineers that successfully make this transition will become the most valuable engineers in the industry by Miles um it won't even be close when you put a decade plus of experience together when you put the technical ability together and when you put together the ability to use AI assistance and AI charge tools I think what you'll end up seeing is a brand new class of senior plus level Engineers that are really really differentiated they'll be the top of the top of the totem pool and they'll be moving at light speed solving problems like no other engineer before okay and then I have another extreme conviction prediction here top performing Engineers adapt to new AI charge Tech by maintaining and curating information channels that keep them up todate on the latest tech and methodologies so this is really important it's really intertwined what I'm predicting here is that top performing Engineers are going to really focus in on their information channels right their information input channels there's going to be a explosion of new content developer content new technology new AIS large language models there's going to be so much to focus on it will be impossible just like it is right now so it's going to be critically important to really curate your information channels keep them as clean as possible keep them as streamline as possible this is something I'm spending a lot more time on you need to be able to filter out the garbage and filter in the valuable useful content ideas technology and methodologies let's talk about big Tech so Tik Tok and social media addiction Tak Center Stage once again and a new regurgitated trend of dopamine fasting Returns the trend is going to blow up and die Tik Tok is going to persist um another kind of related prediction Tik Tok will not get banned it's going to continue its operations without major legal interruptions um I do want to call here uh The Importance of Being able to step away from technology The Importance of Being able to focus and filter out again the hord of content and AI generated content user generated content all of it it's going to be really really crazy and ramped up thanks to llms and generative AI in 20124 you need to be able to step away you need to be able to say I need to go on a walk it's time for me to get away from technology it's time for a little vacay whatever you need to do to recharge and to you know rehumanize yourself rehumanize your experience definitely make sure you're keeping an eye on yourself there and keeping your dopamine levels stable another extreme prediction here this one is an easy prediction to make but the big tech companies are going to maintain their positions the only Ripple in that is going to be open AI as a new significant competitor and as you know they are partners with Microsoft which probably backs up the idea that the big tech companies are literally impossible to break down to break apart the only way to get into this group is to be partners with one of these groups um as we're seeing with open Ai and Microsoft big Tech is going to learn to utilize llms like no one else and they're going to begin turnning out hypers specialized ads that force you to click force is in double quotes here of course no one's forcing anyone to do anything we see an unusual increase in ad conversion due to this specifically from these big tech companies but we don't see any backlash until probably 2025 maybe 2026 when someone publicly calls out a hypers specialized ad designed creepily just for them based on their recent web activity I think this is going to be kind of a shocking moment where we realize that uh we all really are completely dependent and susceptible to the power that you know some of these big tech companies have have garnered over the years so I predict that open AI is going to continue to get sued for their AI models we just saw this happen with New York Times suing them a couple days ago I think you know December 28th or 27th you know they're going to win some they're going to lose some but they're going to move on they already have all the money and all the data they need to continue building their next Generation models there have been lots of talks and ideas around them using uh gb4 to generate the new data for the next model basically they already have everything they need they're going to get sued more it's not going to matter we're going to move on they're going to pay the finds open AI continues to lead the AI race anyone that comes close only does so by analyzing and hijacking open ai's models to generate tests and train their models so this is a very similar prediction to one of my first predictions um basically open a is going to continue to lead the race what we're going to see over the year of 2024 is that we'll see proof that companies are just basically cying open AI their models their training methods and literally using open ai's models to generate new models right I think this whole idea of using models to generate training data for the next model is going to be a pretty strong theme we're going to see throughout 2024 we're going to see Gemini Ultra surpass gp24 turbo and q1 for a brief moment until open AI releases their next Generation model Google runs back to the drawing board and looks for other ways to compete it's likely going to be on the pricing or speed side okay so uh stock and crypto predictions so of course I'm not a financial adviser blah blah blah can't get financial advice you know how it goes Ai and the Magnificent 7 play a key role in cancelling a national recession continuing the disconnect between the stock market trends and the financial realities of most Americans okay so I'm going to predict here that SPX hit 5K in q1 or Q2 and then we're going to have a super volatile year you know we have the geopolitical uncertainties elction uncertainties after a huge dip we're going to see SPX back above 5,000 by the end of the year so I'm predicting that by the end of the year we're going to have SPX above 5,000 and spy above 500 I'm predicting that the concentration of gains in big Tech persist you know throughout 2024 we're going to see that the majority of gains all happen inside of those big tech companies I'm going to predict more than 50% of those gains are going to be in the top 15 companies I'm predicting we'll see the national debt surpass 50 trillion yet it'll remain a lesser discuss issue for another year it's going to set up a growing debt bubble that will pop between 2025 and 2027 I have no idea and I don't think anyone really knows what does it mean when the debt bubble pops here uh for the United States what does that even mean I I don't know um hopefully we won't find out we probably will um moving on economic uncertainties are going to fuel a rally I'm predicting the rally is going to be boosted even further by black Rock's ETF that launches in q1 and I think that we're going to see BTC ending the year above 50k I'm going to predict Salon is going to surpass binance coin as the top fourth crypto in the cryptocurrency markets and then lastly I think we're going to see ethereum surpass the 20% total market capitalization uh ratio so we're going to see eth ethereum own more than 20% of all the total market cap we tapped it maybe once or twice this year I think next year we'll see it Peak above that 20% mark but we'll see it actually hold through the end of the year through the end of 2024 okay let's talk about the job market so remote work is here to stay companies outside of big Tech that enforce office returns experience a loss of employees we'll see a small trend of return to the office but'll mostly be flat by the end of 2024 the engineering job market is going to face an oversaturation at the entry and mid levels which will continue the trend of senior principal and staff Engineers finding ample opportunities and all engineering roles so this is really a continuation prediction of the current state of the engineering Market prompt engineering uh completes its transition from a meme to reality we're going to see specialized job roles for prompt engineering emerging the clear signal that this prediction is correct is that we're going to see prompt-based tasks show up in job interviews we're going to see software Outsourcing intensifies why hire an American um engineer for 100k when you can hire three you know Indian or Brazilian Engineers for 30k a pop and attempt to Rapid prototype to your product Market fit so I think we're going to see this trun continue I think we'll see this specifically for non- senior roles I could be totally wrong about that but I'm banking more so on this being targeted for a junior midlevel which puts more pressure on the middle and the bottom of the market there roll in AIML and Big Data are going to be the most important um as they're kind of the backbone for l M for prediction for model training right I think they're going to rival the emerging prompt engineering positions and the prompt engineering meme positions um are going to be basically you know top three I think we'll see a job board where we see some really high specialized roles some you know uh principal machine learning big data and then right next to it getting paid just as much and offering for a prompt engineering position I think we're going to see demand for front Engineers decrease significantly these are the rules that that are are and will be getting outsourced augmented and eventually automated away completely by llm Technologies for my experience in the the feel of these tools and what I'm seeing in the market right now the front end is going to be the first thing to go because once you build a couple components once you set up that strategy of the look and feel of your website you can prompt with great control the majority of the behavior of even your own custom website so a lot of predictions there I'm going to compress a couple of those uh for for the end of the year let's talk about parto actions so these are the 8020 actions you can take to get ahead in 2024 right I'm focus on becoming an agentic engineer so everything on my channel kind of follows that line we're talking about building the next generation of technology that is powered by your agents right your multi-agent systems you have agents working on your behalf while you sleep you have agents solving problems for you in the background coming to you for additional instructions you have your own workforces here and there your email is fully automated by your own personal agents they only braids top level most important items to you when it's the right time you know that's what my predictions are all about and that's what my paral actions are all about right so how can we get the most bang for a buck you know how can we stand by our predictions in the best way as Engineers that are looking to transform into agentic Engineers we need to treat prompt engineering as a first class skill Embrace prompting techniques tips testing Frameworks and practice prompting as often as you code if you're writing code every day you should be writing multiple prompts every day frankly if you want to get that speed if you want to move fast in the age of AI you need to be using prompts prompts are a new fundamental unit of programming if you don't know how to prompt a function if you can't prompt a module if you can't prompt uh a brand new codebase you need to be learning that in q1 2024 that should be your top priority I just want to make that really clear the prompt is the a new fundamental unit of programming okay you need to select your information sources carefully to stay updated with the latest and software Tech tools models so that you can make the best decisions in the age of AI just like I mentioned in the prediction filtering out information that doesn't matter and filtering in information that does matter is going to be critical so that you can be exposed to the right tools and Technology right tools that software engineers creatives and product Builders are using with their boots on the ground right I'm not talking about hype cycle stuff I'm talking about real valuable software people are actually using to build products to build content select your information sources carefully and make sure you curate your information stream so that you're constantly getting high quality information to help you make informed decisions I think it's really important to be experimenting with local llms like AMA and llama file those are the current ones out right now as of the end of 2023 in December you know to understand the trade-offs between local versus API and free versus paid and the real kind of core of this here is there's going to be a moment when local models can do everything you need them to do and when that happens every second you're not using them you're wasting time and you're wasting money right there will definitely be cases where you need a supercharged up model like the gbt 4 like gbt 5 whatever is coming next there'll be cases where you want to use that maybe you're streamlining your personal development work flow you just need to get things done I get that um but there's going to be a huge huge huge number of things that a local llm can do that you just don't need a stronger model for right so focus on mastering Python and typescript um I don't see these going anywhere I believe we're going to see these kind of lock in place just as we've seen C C++ and Java kind of lock in place as like that core lower level unit of programming language on the web for SC scripting for data analytics for model building we're seeing Python and typescript really lock in I want to highlight focusing on AI tool experimentation even the best Engineers are bounded by their tools so keep looking for new better tools to expand your output and lastly prioritize your remote collaboration skills make sure you know how to communicate effectively in global remote workforces I think things are going to remain remote people love having more time to you know optimize their workflow so that they can return to things that they really enjoy doing working on their side business working on their side project going outside hanging out with their family Sports Health right whatever it is uh I think remote work is a plus plus in the end so we're going to see that Trend continue if you want to stay effective however you need to make sure that you're prioritizing your clear Communication open communication documentation make sure you prioritize your remote collaboration skills okay so those are my predictions I would love to hear your high conviction predictions in the comment section you know drop a like drop a sub drop a comment I would love to hear what you guys think about my predictions you know um I think that's how you make better predictions you get feedback on them you you know you see what other people are predicting do they line up with yours do they not some of the things I didn't mention here uh I don't I don't really talk about web Frameworks anymore I skipped over a couple conversations about serverless technology you know Reliance on large server providers right gcp AWS I kind of skipped over that I think there are some other channels that are you know covering that I really am you know heads down focus on AI charge engineering building agentic software building agents that work for you while you sleep you've heard me say it several times on the channel that's what this channel is all about and the plan for myself and everyone watching the channel is to be at the edge of this stuff so that when the tools become available when the time is right when the technolog is available we're on the edge and we have our agentic systems working on our behalf in the day in the night while we're awake working in parallel with us while we're asleep our agentic systems are going to be at it providing value for us and for our companies and for our businesses and for our work so um yeah we'll love to hear your predictions really appreciate you watching the video especially if you made it all the way to the end you know huge thanks we hit 8K this year you know just huge shout out to everyone who's dropped into the channel things really blew up over the post St analytics series it's really cool to see how that's developed and it's turning into a full-blown product I'll talk about that in another video If you're not a part of the agentic journey that we're going on on this channel hit the like hit the sub thanks so much for watching I will see you in the next one",
