  "raw_transcript": "what's up Engineers Indy Dev Dan here in this video I want to show you the one most important AI coding pattern you can use to maximize the impact you can have with powerful reasoning models and Next Generation language models like GPT 4.5 and whatever new model anthropic is cooking up this is a threepiece combo video we're going to be using everyone's favorite AI code editor cursor this is the name brand in AI coding right now we're also going to be using using a new tool built on top of Aer AER is the best open- source AI coding tool we're going to be using AER inside of a brand new lightweight exclusive AI coding tool I'm excited to share more about this in the video this is an experimental tool for surgical AI code changes and finally you saw it in the title we'll use the tool many Engineers fear the editor of the future the engineering career killer Devon I've been waiting to pull the trigger on this one and after after the 03 Mini model was released I knew that Devon would be in a good place to try and I think I was right about that you'll see what you can do with Devon in this video without spending the massive $500 a month that it takes to get this thing online so it's been a while since we've done some handson AI coding on the channel I have to warn you guys things have changed a lot this video is going to be both weird and awesome what is the one pattern you can use with any AI coding tool and any powerful model to scale your your air coding to new heights let's get right into it so what is the pattern what is the technique it's planning planning is the single most powerful pattern you can use right now to scale your engineering to new heights let me show you how and why instead of cranking out AI coding prompts we're just going to open up cursor and we're just going to start a brand new plain text file this is the beginning of everything we want to build no agent mode no tab tab tab just a blank file so what are we building what are we planning what are we thinking about last week we put together single file agents you can see I'm in that code base right now every one of these files hold some unique capability in an agentic Loop and we can kick one of those off right now with this command I'm going to paste the S and this is going to run a query against an SQL light database in an agent Loop so we're looking for all active users between the score created in 2024 this agent Loop had 10 total compute Loops it only took four to accomplish the task and you can see here here's our exact result coming out of our SQL light database and it automatically understood and interpreted our query properly it fixed all the column names you can see is active equals 1 score between and uh year 2024 right and it also corrected the table for it so this is the power of a compact single file agent I'll go ahead and Link this video in the description if you want to learn more about single file agents in this video we have three tools so let's go ahead and build build three new useful agents first we're going to build a CSV agent this is going to run data analytics queries on top of large th000 10,000 line plus CSV files we're going to hand off this work to Devon and then we're going to build a precise web scraper that pulls content and then reformats it into the right form and then lastly we're going to rebuild anthropics bash and file editing tools into an all-in-one agent we're going to have pack patterns build this up for us so you have a blank file open and your boss just walked by and sees you staring at a blank screen he starts to wonder why he hired you so you're about to show them why I have code Snippets for all of my you know specs and all my plans but let's just go ahead and write this from scratch okay polar CSV agent High Lev overview tasks AKA prompts I don't want to waste your time so I'm going to skip through some of this typing and we're going to walk through the key ideas as we go create a polar open Ai and state API UV run SFA po V2 instead of this we want prompt so this is going to be our user prompt so this is going to be our feedback loop and we can go ahead and just be specific get the relative file path and paste that in and let's say something like what's the average age of users and then at the end here we're going to have- C compute count so how many compute Loops do we want our agent to have yeah CSV pathi since we're passing this work off to Devon Devon can also read links so what I'll do here is just paste in some links that could be useful so I'll say docs and we'll past in both the polers and the UV inline scripts so for our single file agents we are using the inline UV dependencies this allows our python script to run with dependencies as a single file we're going to use that same pattern here implementation details all right so we have a bunch of implementation details here and what I really like to do with the details is just kind of of Consciousness walk through everything that I want the agent to do so just to highlight a couple things here we want to reuse our current existing agent structure we want to specify some of the libraries we're using right so open AI M Rich I'm saying use the O3 model you can see all the tools that we want to agent to have access to list columns sample CSV so on and so forth so the task here AKA prompts is a series of steps that you would take or that you would hand off to a you know junior or mid-level engineer to actually get the job done and we're going to see how important this is you know for tools like Devon for any tool like cursor having these predefined steps inside of the workflow is going to be really really important so I'll go ahead right now and I'll walk through all the individual tasks that I want to actually build out this new single file agent fantastic so what we have here is effectively a list of prompts and you know you may be thinking if you've been with the channel for a while you might be thinking hey we've talked about these before these spec prompts these plans and if you've taken principal AI coding you know that this is a kind of really really key pivotal idea inside of the course yes and yes this is where all engineering will go over time we need to be focusing on packaging our work so that we can do the following instead of actually writing any code instead of you know going into detail I'm just thinking through everything here top to bottom you know we have almost 1,000 tokens here 500 Words detailed in this really clean concise plan and I'm going to do something really amazing now with this I'm just going to copy all this I'm going to open up Devon so how does this work with Devon basically you just write a prompt and Devon has access to your code base and then it operates on your code base on your behalf and then at the end it will create a PR this is going to be really fun so I'm going to paste this write a couple lines here at the top workflow Branch from and I'm just going to pull my current Branch name I think I'm operating on experimentals Implement verify PR back to experimentals branch kick this off so now we're kicking off a Devon AI assistant to do this work for us okay here's kind of what the user interface looks like right you can see all the engineering tools here on the right and on the left you have a chat conversation with Devon and basically it's just going to say you know I understand you want me to do blah blah blah and then it's going to walk through its process live and go kind of Step by Step through everything I'm very impressed with this tool as you'll see it really emphasizes the importance of of creating powerful plans and you know really detailing the work that you want done we talk about maxing out your compute and leveraging compute a lot on the channel this tool is a you know very powerful manifestation of that for the AI coding workflow for engineer you can see here it's created an entire plan that it's going to work through right it has its own agentic planning Loop it has access to the terminal you can see it has my box here with another code base and it is starting to get some work done here so this is really cool we're going to to let our AI coding tool do its job and we're going to continue working on our own okay so we're going to close this and let's go ahead and continue with our second agent and this is going to be work that we're going to hand off to cursor agent mode a really cool part about these new long running plan based AI coding Tool jobs you get into this kind of three-step process where you have a plan step you have a wait step and then you have a review step and so you can do something really cool during this flow I've got into a nice kind of flow here where I am planning awaiting and then reviewing one kind of stream of work and then during the await step right during the weight step I kick off another plan weight review and another AI coding tool and then you can kind of you know basically just continue doing that and eventually you come back to some review step looks like you know uh Devon is not ready for review yet it's still getting work done we're going to go ahead and give it its space so let's go ahead and open up the terminal here and instead of using a a kind of blank file let's go ahead and use pack patterns so we're just going to use pack patterns to create the template so I'm just going to type pack spec new and then inside the specs directory precise scraper agent and this is going to be the markdown so this is going to create a brand new plan for us here we can see here we have this precise scrape agent and so this is a markdown template that we can work with so this is one of several patterns inside of this tool that we'll talk about more in a moment the great part about this tool is that you don't have to actually run the generated document the generated plan with the tool you can use it with any AI coding tool you want so you can see here we have this brand new plan and let's go ahead and I'll work through this again I'm going to skip through some of this so you don't have to sit through the entire plan but it is important to kind of highlight some of the key elements of this right and so I'm going to just delete mid-level objectives you don't really need that here and then I'm going to fill out some of the implementation notes so scraper agent. scrapes based on users it's going to look something like that and so you can see here we're starting to fill out the details I like this idea of starting kind of at the end right starting at the end vision of what you want to see what you would run UV run scraper agent pass a URL pass the output file optionally then we pass in the prompt right and we also have the compute there that we can specify we are at a point where it's important to have some code so I'm going to actually open up the fir crawl documentation here I have it right here you know never be afraid to just throw additional information at at your agents at your plans this is the fir crawl UI I'm going to hit get code and I'm just going to copy kind of the main workflow here for python okay so I'm just going to take that and make sure this is Python block and then I'm just going to paste that in all right so that looks good and if we just scroll through this this looks pretty good we can get rid of some of this noise going to continue with the implementation notes here all right so fantastic so we just have a bunch of details mostly just code and a couple notes on the user prompt details so we going to collapse this and we have this context block since we're operating in uh cursor it's pretty good at picking up on context and reading files is running an agent mode and they can pull that in so we don't really need this I'm just going to go ahead and delete this last but not least you know this is a really important part of every one of your plans it doesn't matter if you're running a yaml plan a plain text file plan markdown plan I highly highly recommend that you have steps tasks right these are effectively prompts that you can run so we're going to walk through these tasks right now and just kind of continue to build off of the implementation notes and the highle objective so that we can pass it off to composer and let composer do the heavy lifting for us so here we have a suite of tasks and without even looking at the details which are effectively themselves prompts remember these are lists of prompts um you can kind of see what this is going to do right build out the scrape tool build out the read local file and update local file tools double check verify the implementation and this is something really cool that you can do and I highly recommend that you do this more and more with these new class of agent based AI coding tools you can ask them to verify their work right so we can take something like this and at the end you can just say you know in addition to like a double check step we just kind of recap everything that you want you can say now run this command to make sure that everything you're doing is up to par right you're literally saying great go ahead and run so you can see here at the end here we're going to query the principal a coding landing page and ask what the names and description of each lesson output in a markdown table so this is how we'll know that our agent did the work so let's go ahead and fire this off and then we'll step back from this plan wait review Loop and while we're waiting we're going to go back to the review step of our uh Devon assistant here which should be oh wow Devon's still working here okay so not quite complete yet we're going to go ahead and let Devon keep cooking um so not exactly sure what's going on here but we're going to let it continue to kind of run there so let's go ahead and run this plan inside of cursor composer with agent mode on so agent Mode's really important because we need to operate on tools we need it to read context we need to uh run terminal commands edit files so on and so forth right so we're giving cursor the control that needs to implement this feature Implement precise agent scraper great verify your work once it's complete with with this command and so that's going to let cursor self validate right so I'm going to go ahead and hit submit here and let's watch cursor in agent mode build out this new agent this is really cool running several tools here in it's agent loop it's listing the directory it's reading file so it's referencing this file that we said to you know reference throughout our plan and so now it's working on actually generating this code so now it's generating our uh scraper agent great so you can see there it got the single file UV depend Tendencies at the top we got our fir crawl import and if we open up the file here you can see it making progress right it's implementing it looks like step by step clearly it's not done yet only 200 lines there we go we got a nice patch coming in there bunch of work coming in look at this we have 2.5k tokens and let's just go ahead and see how everything's going that's good so it's checking to make sure that I have the fir craw API key you can see it read that um and I need to make sure that it doesn't leak my API key anywhere here okay looks like we're good you can see here it actually ran my execution Loop and it saw that there was an error right so so this is really really powerful it has all the context of my plan all the code that it generated and it has the execution Command right it's able to close the loop and actually run things end to end and then if there's something you know that's gone wrong it'll fix it itself right this is a key idea from Principal a coding that we've discussed and we can see it coming through in a lot of the modern you know agent-based modes right the loop is being closed here in a lot of these tools you can see here cursor just walking through several things here now it's just continuing to smash that output command and make sure that things are looking good and so as we'll see in a moment this is a pattern that I built directly into pack patterns this is a lightweight AI coding tool for large scale Max compute low error Engineering in the generative AI age I'm trying to pack a lot of value in this video here um so I don't want to you know over stuff it but this is going to be a new tool available for principal a coding members that have completed principal a coding I wanted to create something that has the patterns that we've discussed embedded inside of a lightweight tool that's what this is again more on that in a second when we write the plan that will execute inside of pack patterns but um if we hop back to Devon here we can see that it uh created a PR for this agent let's go ahead and view this PR and this is really cool right now right we have two agents running two agents getting work done for us our uh cursor agent here is running and has exceeded our Max Loops I'm going to go ahead and stop it here it looks like it's gotten the kind of main flow down I'm going to accept the changes here so we can review this code in a second let's go ahead and check the response from Devon to see how we're doing here this is really cool so when you're operating in Devon it acts like an engineer so you can see here it wrote a bunch of code changes here it ended up with 600 line changes from our 100 line plan um that's the multiplier you want to see and if we hop into the file changes it will perfectly only have this one file right we just said create a new single file agent that's what it's done here we can quick scroll through the changes and see all of our open AI pantic structures we can see our tools here here's our prompt this looks fantastic it's really listening to what I wanted and it's listening to the exact prompt that we gave it you can see are two Dynamic variables inside of our prompt there's our tools and the tool here that really matters is if we look for our Ron poers code let's look at this so where's our polers code poers python code and if we just search this it is actually just going to split the lines on a temporary file and just run the polar code after pulling in the data frame here okay very interesting so uh this looks good and you can see here we have our main loop with all of our arguments pretty impressive stuff right there's our open AI 03 mini call a lot of work is happening here a gentically big shout out to Devon and all the work done here just to make it super clear there's likely going to be some issues inside of these kind of harder to run you know methods I'm literally having the agent generate polar's python code and then run it inside of a temp file as a single tool call so I'm going to be super impressed if this runs all the way through if nothing else this code is what 80 90 maybe 95% there and then we can push it all the way home or if we want to we can come in here and explicitly just add additional feedback for Devon but but this looks good I'm not going to do anything else here you can see that it did self verify talking about this pattern a lot right Clos Loop systems self verifiability inside of your AI coding tools Devon can do this right both Devon and you saw here in cursor cursor can also do this all right so we have self verifiability inside the tool it ran this and it successfully calculated the average age here 37.87 years as a way to quickly validate that those changes might be good we can just go into Data we can look at the analytics file we a prompt at this what's the average age you know just running an inline selection prompt here from Sonet uh it looks like it's 37.8 so this looks right let's go ahead and close this and I'm just going to go ahead and merge in this change from Devon so I'm going to uncomment that go ahead and let that merge so this is great we have that new agent while we're working on this agent right so I really love that idea right you have this stack of plan weight review and again during the weight step you can start another plan weight review and then during that weight step you can review or start another plan weight review right so this is a new workflow I'm playing with I'm getting a lot more done with a two to three AI cing assistants that have some type of agentic workflow that have some long running plan based flow inside of it before we merge in let's go ahead and finish up our scraper AI agent that we're building with composer agent and cursor here so I want to let the agent continue to make progress here so what I'll do here is I'll just copy this I'll go to the terminal and I'll just want to test this out so I want to see content's been scraped next I'll read okay I've retrieved I've extracted names have been okay so something is not going right here let's just copy the issue here and hand it back to composer so what's the issue here from our SFA scraper and I'll just past in the error here and let's see what it comes up with so let me take a look at this prompt here we have the URL user prompt this all looks good it looks like we are scraping and what's getting run here actually okay so it looks like it has to update the prompt for something so this is not operating exactly as we wanted to that's okay I don't want to overstress on the implementation here we're going to give it another shot and then we'll move on from cursor agent mode here if we're not seeing the exact results we want to see so let's go ahead and let it spin a little bit further here it made some changes now it's going to run again and let's see if it can properly call these tools I am seeing that we're missing some of the inside uh tool calls these just aren't showing up in the log so it looks like it's actually not um you know completely calling the right tools um actually that might be the issue so I want that log here right so I want to console print here and I want it to look like this there we go now let's run this again run again there we go so this is the issue you can see here this is why logging is very important you want to create visibility for your agent think from your agent's perspective uh the problem here is that the tool call names were actually wrong this if statement did not match properly so it did not even call the right tool all right so we're going to stop the process here um this workflow has you know kind of gone Ary I'm sure it's a couple steps away if we go ahead and zoom out wow okay so this is definitely a problem right we're running TBT 3.5 there's clearly something going on here right it looks like our tools are actually not bad it definitely went off the rails this is a good example of me giving the agent a little bit too much agency as soon as it added that kind of workflow step here it broke that typical agentic Loop so you know my fault for not using the tool right but also frustrating that even with this really kind of clear concise plan the agent wasn't able to properly get to the right space that's fine this is something that I'm going to you know fix up tune and I'll make sure this actually lands in the code base let's go ahead and pull in our changes from Devon so I'll just run uh get pool okay and so we have our brand new polar agent here from Devon let's go ahead let's give this a whirl and if we open up that plan and just copy out that validation you know verification command and let's just run [Music] this and I'm just going to kick this off all right so nice there's our clean agent Loop just like we asked for in that same structure as our previous uh V2 agents and wow look at that so we have list columns nice there's our sample CSV ARS wonderful so you can see there our agent is getting a sample and wow and there's the code right so it generated code it ran the code and then it just ran oh we got a little issue here okay okay so not too bad right for a task as complex as this um Devon actually made this run first go this is really really cool and if I just search I wonder if I just search for age I should not see this in the code at all right CU that means that it generated it itself okay so this is good I don't see this at all outside of this comment and if we just search for you can see our sample code there sample CSV method list that looks great and if we go to run test polers yeah you can see here we're passing in polar python code and then that's getting executed so this is pretty fantastic so it looks like we got a little error here and this should have fed back into our agentic Loop that's fine you know this is something that we can run with a follow-up prompt I'm going to hold off on that you likely already understand the iterative process but this is really cool right we handed off this entire process to Devon by writing this plan here polar CSV agent right so we have this nice four-step plan fourth step is verify uh we gave it all the details it needed implementation details docs and state and you know even though our cursor agent didn't get the job done for us it did a pretty good job of getting us you know to that first draft here in our scraper agent right there is definitely still uh work to be done in the agent space you're seeing a lot of AI coding tools push toward that pack spec new and we're going to write specs bash file anthropic agent and for the pattern I'm going to use list director this is an experimental pattern but it is very powerful so let me show you exactly what this looks like here is a spec prompt so you know starting from the top here we're running the director pattern pack patterns comes with a suite of patterns that you can run we're running in architect mode remember this is built directly on top of Aer so all the you know niceties and model names and conventions it's all built right on top of Aer and so we have a main model we have an editor model and then we have something cool here we have an evaluator model we then have our editable context and our read only context and then just like you saw in our previous plans we have our highle objective also implementation details and then last but not least we have our tasks so there's something really important about these tasks that you'll notice here not only do we have a title and a prompt we also have evaluator count and evaluator command this is basically saying when we finish this AI coding prompt when our assistant finishes writing this code for us run this command take the output and feed it right back in to the assistant and if it fails do it end times so this allows us to you know close the loop on the system and this is something that's really important that we talk about in principal AI coding this is my take on how to transition from the old ways of engineering to the new ways of engineering with a coding assistants this is a topic we dig into a lot in lesson s let the code right itself like I mentioned throughout this video you're seeing this new pattern emerging inside of these powerful AI coding assistants with agent mode and agent mode is just the first version of this right we saw here in Devon that it was able to you know run this uh verify um you know we said verify you can see verification verified verified right this is a pattern that powerful AI coding tools agentic tools must build in we're going to see this in every single powerful a coding tool that stays relevant you need to close the loop to close the loop you need to you know concretely have a verification command and inside of pack patterns that's known here as the evaluator command so you're going to run that and that enables you to take the output from whatever prompt you just ran right the current state of your application say you're running you know Pi test is the most obvious one you know you can take that command you can take the output feed it back into a model and then take that model and have the model talk to your AI coding assistant all right and so that's what the evaluator model is again we talk about this a lot and you know among other kind of really key AI coding principles and patterns that are you know slowly going to become mainstream talk about all this in principal a coding feel free to check this out link is going to be in the description it's going to be available to all principal AI coding members that have completed the course consider this just a bonus you know this tool is a simple way for me to provide more value to principal a coding members to access this tool you can go to the dashboard and then once you have completed every lesson you unlock exclusive member only assets the new asset here that we're going to have available is the pack patterns CLI AI coding Library so again this is a thin experimental lightweight tool built on top of Aer and it consists of several different patterns I've you know put a lot of work into the documentation here so feel free to jump in here check it out uh get installed you know set up your API key it's going to be really really simple to get started the key idea here is that um plans are the future of engineering plans are how you package and set up large scale changes and then you hand it off to Great air coding tools like like Devon like cursor and like pack patterns uh that I'm going to show you here right now so I'm going to Blink through creating this prompt all right so I've filled out this spec prompt with pack pattern spec files you specify both the editable context and the readon context just as if you were in an AER instance same deal here right we have all of our implementation details you can see here I have the example API call here with our bash editor agent from anthropic to kick off these spec prompts we can run pack spec run and then just pass the path and uh that's it so now our AI coding assistant is going to uh take all of these details format it for us in the right way and then run our prompts top to bottom we covered a lot of ground here in this video from Devon to cursor to pack patterns what I want to showcase here really is you know a concrete methodology a concrete pattern for scaling up your compute usage as these AI coding tools and really just as generative AI tools gain the ability to run these long running a gentic Loops we're going to be able to do more and more so how can we do more instead of just running a single prompt instead of going into uh chat mode or opening up a single AER instance we can always just go you know AER Sonet sfas right we can always hop in here and you know ask what is this and you know write a coding prompts right um but we can do a lot better you saw here with Devon with a great plan it was able to end to end you know with many tool calls with prompting with whatever systems they have going on here systems like this are going to continue to emerge and in order for us to take advantage of them in order for us to really hand off more and more of our work in order for us to scale up the amount of work we can accomplish it's going to be really important that we create the right packages for these tools the kind of key package is very clearly uh plans right it's very clearly just plans where you can detail out exactly what you're looking for at implementation details and then most importantly a list of prompts all pack patterns is by the way for anyone that wants to implement this on their own you basically just create a loop over your AI coding assistant and some prompts right that's the kind of you know fundamental version of what pack patterns is doing obviously I've added a lot of bells and whistles and the list director pattern here is one example of that and you know literally it's right out of the principal AI coding course if you've taken the course you'll know exactly what's going on uh with this tool you know you'll be able to really fly through all the documentation here it's going to make a ton of sense to you right you have a pattern you want to create a new spec file and it all starts with a simple list pattern right so literally just a list of prompts and then from there we can add more interesting patterns like the director pattern to scale or compute and to hand off more of the work to our AI coding assistant right and you're seeing that here with the director Loop probably going to get there in a second here yeah so we're on the last prompt here and so after this prompt kicks off we're going to be add a review and validate step in which case after this a coding prompt runs we're then going to have pack patterns executed and take any feedback any errors and feed it right back into our AI coding assistant all right um You can see here yep so now we're on step three review and validate if we scroll up here you can see all the previous work right we had linting issues that were fixed and here is you know all of our tools this is all getting built out this looks really really great right so look at this massive you know large scale change and if we scroll to the bottom here we should get into our director Loop so yep so here we are so this is really cool so now we're getting our agent to you know execute the code and then provide feedback there it is wow fantastic um so this is crazy I'm actually shocked to see if this actually uh oneshotted this entire process um let's let's see uh that's crazy success true okay so let's just try it so I'm going to take this command and you know it's running a simple prompt right this is our anthrop bash editor agent and I'm not even going to open the agent um and all we're doing here is list all python files all right so our new tool has bash access and it can also edit files for us so I'm just going to say list all python files let's see how it does here okay so let's see okay so the agent Loop definitely completed successfully and where's that LS if we just search LS we should see that here yeah LS star python okay fantastic so it looks like we're not getting the actual output here let's go ahead and open up this agent and this should be relatively simple to fix we actually might be able to have csor just quickly come in here for us and get the result for us so exactly yeah so that's that and then let's go ahead and just rerun this now we should get our results uh printed out for us yeah look at that tool results fantastic so incredible uh just to highlight it again you know this is the power of a great plan okay I just one shoted that work it looks like we have you know 1,000 tokens 99 lines here you know it does take some upfront work some upfront investment to think through all the work you went done as you can see here but once you do that and once you pair it with powerful models you can see here we have a model stack of three models that ran 280 seconds here and you can see here we have an evaluation Loop that's confirming right it ran this code for us and it confirmed that things are working all right so this is really cool um I'm going to clean up these agents you can check these out in this code base and you know something really cool here you'll be able to see the uh PR that Devon made that's going to be merged in here merg into the code base you can see its commits here um so really cool stuff unfortunately we didn't get agent mode to properly you know work through those changes for us that's fine we gave it a little bit too much agency and you know I don't think that um cursor's composer can handle these large plans yet uh we'll see how that you know develops in the future I think really cursor is more for iterative step by step I really want to highlight you know the tools that let you create plans that you can then hand off tons of work you know entire features those are the tools you're going to want to look for all right so you know once again just a pitch it principal a coding pack patterns is available now for all principal a coding members that have completed uh the entire course this is just an extra bonus for members and it's more incentive for anyone that's interested in principal a coding to you know go ahead sign up give it a shot you know once again there's a uh full refund guarantee if you bail before the fourth lesson this is my take on how to stay relevant in the age of AI with AI coding as you saw in this video there's a lot of interesting new powerful AI coding techniques and fullon agentic workflows you know agents that are going to be tackling this problem and you know if you're not on this boat if you don't understand what you can do 2025 is it I'm going to be the first guy to just say it to your face if you're not using AI coding Tools in 2025 you won't make it to 2026 you will not be on an upward trajectory anymore you need AI coding tools to scale your impact if you like this video you know what to do like comment subscribe thanks so much for watching stay focused and keep building",
