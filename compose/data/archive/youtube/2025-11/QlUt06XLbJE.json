  "raw_transcript": "what's up Engineers Indie Dev Dan here I have an action-packed AI coding Dev log for you today I'll be commenting over this AI coding session to share insights and techniques with you we'll be using the best two AI coding assistants AER and cursor to do all the heav lifting for us in this new bun code base I'll show you how you can use these two tools together to ship more code in less time we'll also show off the secret sauce of AI coding it's likely not what you think it's not really cool or interesting but as you advance in your engineering career you learn that using this pattern will greatly increase your engineering productivity in both speed and quality so right away I want to share something really cool with you that can help you get up and running with AER across code bases AER has this do configuration yaml file where you can effectively configure anything you can think of so right now I'm going through enabling sonit 3.5 prompt caching I'm disabling autoc commits I prefer to commit myself and now I'm setting up something really interesting I'm setting up this test command and this auto test flag this hints at the secret sauce but we'll get into that more later in the video we're setting up some more Flags here this is a really cool feature AER has you can specify readon files that will not get updated when you're prompting they won't be included as an option for AER to update so I'm adding the read me and this conventions file so what is the conventions file this is a really interesting pattern that's emerging with AI coding tools conventions are rules that you want your AI coding assistant to follow as their writing code for you so you can see here just a markdown file and I'm just going to write a couple bullet points here with details about how I want AER to write code in this code base this is the great part about this AER configuration file so you can have a base configuration file that you use AC cross code bases and then you can update it on a per code base basis so we're creating some project structure here I created the modules and the tests and the types file I'm really curious here how do you like to handle your typescript types do you have them all in a single file or do you have them spread across features logical groupings or you know individual components comment down below how do you like to store your typescript files in your codebase I've been using this pattern of having a single types file on the top level and it's worked out really well it's easy to search it's easy to find types and llms love that they can find all the types in a single file so just working through our configuration here I'm moving the types to the file key value pair and I'm also adding the index.ts so now whenever we boot up AER we're going to get these files so little mistake here I actually misnamed the AER configuration file it's do comp not config so after we fixed that we can reboot AER and now you can see automatically we have prompt caching enabled and we have our conventions read me index and types files automatically added to our context window so that's awesome now I'm going to update the readme with a reformatted version of our setup nothing too crazy happening here all right so we're opening up a new window here using my BD Alias to kick off the index file and we got hello via Bond so that's all working great now we're going to start setting up our notion client so what are we working on here what are we actually building we are setting up a notion API wrapper class so a product I'm working on right now needs to have support for running crud operations on notion Pages I'm going to run the first AER prompt I'm just going to say add main to index.ts and this is just kind of a standard pattern where you have a main function that kicks off the flow of your application so we do that and I'm just going to go ahead run that AER is just going to immediately suggest that command so we ran that and something really cool happened there um you know due to our auto test flag uh AER automatically ran BUN test after our prompt this is a really really powerful pattern as we progress in this AI coding Dev log you'll see exactly how impactful that can be so we're going to go ahead create a couple additional files here we're going to create our notion module which will hold all of our Logic for our notion wrapper class we've added both those notion files to our context window here so now we're going to update notion and create our notion wrapper class right so this is going to be a simple prompt that initializes our notion class that we can reuse across the life cycle of the application so just firing that prompt off here we are of course using Sonic 3.5 there's really no other model to use for top tier coding results you can see here we have a brand new notion rapper class so this looks great now it's time to start setting up our tests so I'm running an update command for our test and basically we just want a simple Bond test that is going to run git page for us so we're frying that prompt off and you can see that test automatically was run thanks to our auto test configuration so it is mocking a lot of codee in that test so what we're going to do right now is we're going to move our notion page ID into that test file so when you're building on notion when you're using the notion API you always specify notion page ID and in order to use this in both the test and the rest of the application we're just going to go ahead and move that into our brand new constants file so this is really cool I was able to prompt AER and just ask for a brand new file uh we have an error here this before each doesn't exist needs to be imported and this is just something that was missed so AER automatically asks if it can you know fix the change I said yes and it went ahead and fixed that particular issue so we were running into another issue here where notion page ID uh is trying to match the result ID which is not what gets returned there so what I'm going to do here is manually run this test again and just print out the result and what I'll do now is ask for this code to get updated ask for the test in particular to get updated and then I'm just going to paste in the response blob right so I don't really care what this test validates against I just wanted to validate against something right so I'm going to pass that object into AER and it's going to update the test and basically just fix it so you know validate against something more legitimate so you can see there now it's checking against page emoji icon and uh the actual title of the not page so that's great I deleted a couple items there we only need one of those to really validate the test so now we're going to update our index.ts notice this pattern that I'm reusing right in the beginning I say update or create and then the file colon and then I specify what exactly there you know in that file or files we want to change so right now we're going to update our index.ts and we want to create some type of CLI application where we can run multiple commands to test the different pieces of our notion API wrapper so we're going to use Commander for that this is really nice bun is asking us if we want to or sorry AER is asking us if we want to automatically run bun add Commander which is the CLI package we went ahead and said yes for some reason it also generated this git page list method which doesn't exist so I'm going to go ahead and clean that up here this is I think one of maybe two hallucinations throughout this AI coding session so all right so we're going to remove this get page list this is going to be a simple prompt I'm just going to say remove get page list and it doesn't exist anywhere else so I'm just going to drop it from the index.ts you can see I've modified index.ts so I need to reload this file there's the updated version with our brand new Commander CLI application so that looks great again reusing this AI coding prompt pattern you say the action and then the file and then you describe what you want to happen in that action right so I'm saying create ad text I'm using a function like syntax here this is really important specifying the typescript type of our parent block there and I'm also saying update the test as well right so this is really cool ader is doing all the heavy lifting for us here updating multiple files at the same time all we did was create you know a two sentence prompt maybe really like one and a half so this is great um again I want you to really pay attention to this pattern here two tests automatically pass we just created a new test our code is getting validated with every single prompt we're running and you know we're just getting started here we only have two methods but that pattern is already doing a lot of work for us so you can see here in the notion page we have our ad test actually creating a new notion block for us and you know here I'm going to try to run two at the same time um getting a little conflict error there um I'm not even sure that's the right bash command to to run back to back but nevertheless we have our new ad command working great and you know I am kind of flipping back and forth between notion and our CLI application mostly just to show you I'm using another keyword here this mirror keyword we've talked about this in previous a coding devlogs but it's super useful for replicating patterns and here I'm just going to say you know we want a delete block command and function so we're going to get that updated in our c C and in our notion. TS notion rapper class I noticed that it did not create a test for us you can see there are still only two tests so I'm just going to quickly reprompt and say create a test for deletion again you can see this pattern doing a lot of work for us after every prompt it's running every test uh our code is getting automatically validated for us this is the secret sauce of AI coding it's very likely that in the future we'll have a bunch of AI coding testing agents that will use tests to validate that they're working properly right so how do you know that your code is working and what's the fastest easiest way for a llm to know that they did the right thing the feedback loop of l m and agentic workflows is a massive kind of open question there's a lot of value there and if you can crack that your agentic workflow becomes so much more powerful and your product becomes so much more powerful because your AI agents can self- validate so this is going to be a pattern that we're going to see in AI coding assistants moving forward the ability to create tests to validate the code that they just wrote is incredibly powerful um all right so what are we doing here we are updating our CLA application I just want some usage docs some usage comments above every single uh method here and you can see I'm using the hashtag symbol here pound symbol AER CAU that as an error and is automatically fixing it for us it knows we're in jsts land and we need slash slash I go back and forth between Python and typescript all the time so a little bit of language blurring going on there and now I just want to test out this delete block command so I'm going to copy this block ID in notion and after we run this so we're going to you know get the actual ID which is just the final segment here and after I've run this we should see that block get completely removed right so just walking through with that usage command shout out to cursors cursor tab feature and there we go there is that block has been completely deleted deled so now we know that that is working our test automatically validated that for us but you know it's nice to see things visually and now we're going to keep moving so so what's next we have this really great structure and pattern we have kind of three levels one is our actual notion wrapper class the other is our tests and then the top level is our index CLI application right so we have kind of one Central code level and then two above it that effectively just validate that it works properly so we're going to update our notion test file and we want to test this case where we want to add a block that has a parent I'm asking for a new test for this since it'll just reuse the ad text function so we're going to move our mock parent ID to our constants file we'll see that automatically pop in there from AER awesome so we got that automatically written and again you can see our automatic tests validating everything we're doing we can see that new test was created and validated if we search all our mock parent block ID will take us right to that test I'm just going to run this test by itself you you can update you can use the only function on your tests to you know run individual tests you can also just update the AER configuration file to run you know only the test file that you're working on so say you're working on a new feature you don't need to run every test right that would be a lot in some code bases um you know in some code bases you'll have hundreds of files you don't want to be rerunning that with every PR to run so you know you can dial it in focus in on just the feature you're working on it's a high output pattern to rerun all the related tests after every single prompt so now we're going to fix our example docs so you can see there we have this like a line 25 line 15 uh this notion - CLI this is the second hallucination I just want to kind of remove that I don't want that to be notion C I want it to be bu run so you can see there that got updated at least mostly and all of our tests ran so we've got three methods working right now that's great we are missing a big one right we now need a read all method so you know get page blocks which will get all of the content from our notion page so this is a tricky function as you'll see we actually need to not only get the blocks but we need to for each block get the correct type of the block and potentially if the block has children we need to also recurse on each block so we'll get to that one step at a time we're going to run a multifile prompt here create a new typescript type and we're going to create a brand new method so I asked for three files to get updated here and AER is going to update every single file we're kicking off our test you can see we have five tests running now and now we're just going to inspect our git blocks function so you can see there it's only pulling in paragraphs which is something important to need to address but we did miss our get page blocks on our index.ts Command level so I'm just going to go ahead and add that I didn't actually you know explicitly add that into my the update portion of my prompt so AER listened and it didn't update that file right uh if we run that get the results out of that um I'm actually going to add it to the clipboard here you can see this is what our git text looks like so you can see we're missing a lot of text that's because of what I mentioned earlier right we're only parsing paragraph items so I'm looking through the notion examples to parse text from any block type so we don't just want paragraphs we also want you know URLs we want embeddings we want uh math equations we want code blocks and in order to support this I'm going to go ahead and first off add this code in a new docs file so this is another AI coding pattern that you can utilize ize to add documentation right so basically this is just a markdown file that contains you know docs or code or both surrounding a specific topic right so I'm adding a new readon file this is really cool in AER you can add readon files so it's never an option to update that file and I'm going to add parse content. markdown into our readon file context I created this new notion utils file and now I'm going to say update notion utils I want to implement the code inside of our parse content markdown file right so I want that block parsing functionality inside this notion utils file so this is a pretty powerful prompt we're really digging into the value of AI coding right the ability to read large pieces of information much faster and then write the code again much faster than you or I right doesn't really matter if you're pushing out 150 words per minute with no mistakes um the AI coding assistant will be able to outcode you so you can see here our notion utils got updated and it's looking pretty good we're looking through the changes here we're going to want to make a couple tweaks to um to the type it's only storing the block ID and the text and as you can see on line 87 it's actually storing the text and the type together in this weird string so uh we're going to update that we going to say update the simple block type to include a new key value pair you might be asking why didn't I just manually add that well as you can see here we're updating multiple files now based on that one edition right the test got updated the top level index file got updated and the actual code itself got updated right and then after all that every single one of my tests ran right so you can see here I'm coding with AI faster than never before I'm also validating the changes faster than ever before because AER is effectively operating as both an AI coder and an AI testing agent so I hope you can kind of see all the value that I'm getting out of this tool right now here's another great feature uh it just coded an error it noticed that and it immediately fixed the error I I actually don't even know what went wrong but uh there was some lenting error and it resolved it immediately um so you know we're reducing cognitive load we're reducing the amount of decisions we need to make on a micro level so we can focus more in the macro level right so here you can see I'm printing out all the blocks once more we don't have any empty uh text blocks anymore but we are getting this weird output format uh where we're you know specifying the type and we don't have any of our nested items right so all of our nested blocks basically were ignored so we're going to go ahead and fix that here you can see in the search none of our nested items are getting picked up that's because a notion you need to recurse underneath a specific block so we're going to make that change right now we're going to again we're using this same pattern you want to say update and then you specify the file or files and then you say what exactly you want to have changed right so now the prompt the AI agent the llm is localized it's scoped to this specific block of code right or this specific file or files so I'm updating to say you know this parse blocks method should return our type and if it sees has children equals true it needs to recurse uh and call itself again to get all the children underneath it so again this is something that would take uh even the fast engineer quite a bit of time um and this is something that you'd kind of have to walk through manually to make sure you're getting all the logic right um I'm not doing that right I'm asking my AI coding assistant what I want I'm waiting I'm reviewing the changes validating it with tests automatically and then I'm moving on so you can see here we have a error here um we have a we updated the type it's not going to return a string it's going to return an object now so AER picked up on that it asked if it could make the fix I said yes of course and now it's making the fix it's rerunning all the tests and it's automatically validating that change right this is I know I keep repeating this but you know engineering coding Building Products is all repetition it's about doing the right thing over and over and over and getting yourself locked into these patterns that make it hard for you to do something wrong you can see there we now have our nested content which is awesome and we have the you know every single one of our nested blocks is now showing up in our output um I'm going to make another change here we are missing the parent ID so I'm just going to come into ader here using that same AI coding prompt pattern update notion utils and then I'm saying uh you know I only want the text block to be the block content and I guess it's in a a future prompt where I add the parent ID but this is going to clean up the text so that we're only getting the actual block contents uh the block text content awesome so using cursor here to uh locally update this file the way I like to use AER and cursor together is I like to use AER for my big multi-file changes across the codebase in a specific context setting and then I use cursor for as you'll see here like to use cursor for uh in file uh block specific code changes right so I use cursor to kind of dial in a change and I use AER to make multiple changes across multiple files over a longer session and of course you can use cursor to do both but uh I find that AER has higher accuracy and it's a lot simpler and concise so here I'm going to update the notion utils once again and I'm also going to say update the types as well because we need this new block ID and that's it so I'm just saying add parent block ID right and again AER updating both those files and again AER via the auto test configuration running all my tests a lot of validation happening here a lot of uh engineering happening kind of automatically if you will right so you can see here we now have our blocks in Json format thanks to that cursor prompt and we also have this parent block ID so now every you know we have this really clean flat array with the parent block ID specified when they exist and when they don't they're null so this is fantastic right our notion API wrapper is is fully Alive we can read we can write we can delete we're doing a lot in a small amount of time so we're going to make a couple additional changes here I'm going to say update notion we're going to update test we're going to update index we're looking for an update block command so you know right now we have create delete read we need to finish the crud and make sure that we can actually update so I randomly forgot here that we could update text and using the notion API so I just asked AER using the SL ask command uh if that was possible so uh it was kind of a dumb question it definitely is possible just kind of like had a brain glitch here um you know it's another kind of cool way you can lean on your AI coding assistant just ask a question at random and now I went ahead made that change updated those three files and you can see there it created that brand new test should update block if we crack open that test you can see it looks pretty good I want to update the initial text here so I'm using a cursor prompt for that cursor selection prompt and I just want it to be a little bit different and I wanted to assert that it wasn't that value so just being a little uh particular about the test here and then I add the only modifier to the test just to test that one one method right so that's a quick way to you know isolate your tests and validate one test so we got that running we now can update um notion nodes so here's a manual test manual validation there really is no harm in you know double triple validating your code um the only cost of course is time but I'm going to come in here and just you know use some cursor tabbing to automatically get this CLI command in the right form and uh you know creating a nice update message there writing code with AI is crazy so true and now we're just going to go Ahad and run that Command right so now we're going to see that block updated fantastic that is up live and running so so we're just going to make some updates here updating the read me with some additional documentation kind of showcasing how things work so you know these these next couple of prompts are all about that I want to comment on either versus cursor and this tool versus that tool that model versus that model you know for the time being at least thinking of gen AI tools as you know one ring to rule them all or one tool to rule them all it just sets you back it's much better to think of your toolkit as you know a top three or top five list where you go between these tools you use them together you learn you learn the good parts and the bad parts about specific tools as we said in our previous AER video it's really too early to put all your eggs in one basket it's too early to pick winners so I recommend just as a engineering principal you know in the age of generative AI don't pick a single favorite or best tool pick you know one 2 3 or four play with them understand them pick out the pros and cons and just kind of give it all time for things to emerge give it time for these tools to emerge and also you know if you see something that's missing in the ecosystem you know you can build it that's the the beautiful thing about these AI coding tools it's never been easier to build out these tools yourself so you can see here we now have usage documentation for a brand new notion API wrapper that looks beautiful it's a in place uh just kind of doing some code review here uh we did all this in I think 40 45 minutes this is a you know part one of a two-part series there are so many incredible things we can do with these tools and I really like this AI coding devlog format for that reason right I can sit down write code with AI and then really reflect and share my process with you so I am actively building an AI coding course it's going to contain a crap ton of value for you it's going to be the most comprehensive principled and practical course on AI coding I want to release it right after the next class of models drop so I can you know include any of the new Innovations and AI coding that will happen so stay tuned for that I'm really excited to release that to you for you that's going to be a big win-win situation in the next video we'll push this code base further if that interest you like sub stay focused keep building and I'll see you in the next one",
