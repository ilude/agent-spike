  "raw_transcript": "Chat GPT is launching a social network as a standalone app. This is a direct shot across the bow at Meta and Zuck. This product is intended to be old style Facebook, old style Instagram. It is about you and your friends. They are very very sensitive to the accusation that AI is going to produce slop on the internet. They have seen Meta's terrible PR experience with AI girlfriends and boyfriends. They've seen this broad and pervasive impression that people have that AI is wrecking social media. And they want two things out of that. One, they want to make sure that they are perceived as the good guys. And two, they want to make sure that they can show a path for AI being used responsibly.",

    "description": "What\u2019s really happening with OpenAI\u2019s Sora 2 launch?\nThe media is full of hype about how long and realistic the videos are (like 16 seconds, let's not hyperventilate guys). \n\nBut it's NOT just a video tool. It's a lot more. It's the next move in OpenAI's strategy for social media domination.\n\nIn this video, I share the inside scoop on why Sora 2 is a friend-centric social network and what that signals for AI strategy, LLMs, and monetization:\n\u2022 Why OpenAI is shipping Sora 2 as a standalone social network.\n\u2022 How friend-cameos counter \u201cAI slop\u201d and onboard new creators.\n\u2022 What Pulse cards, Sora, and checkout reveal about ad funnels.\n\u2022 Where this pressures Snap, Meta, and Google heading into Q4.\n\nFor teams and operators, the opportunity is safer AI-powered engagement via new ad surfaces\u2014while the risk is eroding trust if ads ever bleed into core ChatGPT answers.\n\nSubscribe for daily AI strategy and news.\nFor deeper playbooks and analysis: https://natesnewsletter.substack.com/",
