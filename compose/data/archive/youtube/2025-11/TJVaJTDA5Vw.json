  "raw_transcript": "Lies travel faster than truth and Reddit lies travel fastest of all. There's a Reddit lie out there that Chad GPT cannot help you anymore with legal and medical advice. This is simply not true. In fact, it never was true. The only thing that actually happened is that OpenAI made a minor change to their terms of service intended to govern liability with lawyers and with doctors. And someone on Reddit dramatically, perhaps intentionally, misinterpreted that and created a viral misinformation campaign that is spreading all over the internet right now, falsely claiming that Chat GPT will no longer give people legal or medical advice. I have people in my DMs threatening to cancel their OpenAI subscriptions. It is completely ridiculous. It is entirely unnecessary and it is a good example of why anytime you see a headline about AI if you can test it, if you can check it because that's what I did. I went straight to chat GPT and I just tested it and it turns out I get legal advice and medical advice the same as I always did. Nothing changed. Anyway, I actually, ironically enough, I swear I didn't plan this. I wrote an article about how to use chat GPT in medical and legal situations for today, including a prompt pack. The prompt pack still works. It's still super effective. It's a smart way to approach really complicated, highstake stuff. It can save you thousands of dollars if you're in a nasty situation. And I have a real story of how someone did that and saved $160,000. Very fun. But please just don't believe internet rumors, especially if they come from Reddit. Reddit is not a good place to get your news from. And I wish the people who reported the news would bother to check their own AI instances before doing so because it's really disrespectful to the rest of us to spread rumors like this and I'm really tired of",
