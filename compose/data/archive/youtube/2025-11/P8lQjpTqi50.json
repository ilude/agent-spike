  "raw_transcript": "here are three AI coding assistant prompt keywords you can use for fast concise AI powered engineering let's start with our first keyword mirror I'll open up cursor inside this module we have a function here click on navbar we're passing in a UI variable and you can see here based on whatever UI is passed in we run arbitrary code we run this add action function and then we open up this modal here so let's say we're adding a new feature and and we want to add a new upgrade button to our Navar functionality using our AI coding assistant and the mirror keyword we can get this done in just three words using this oneshot prompt I'm going to start an inline completion And all I'll say here is navbar upgrade mirror navbar community and that's it I'll hit enter and let it generate so as you can see here we coded that faster than never before it mirrored the community and everywhere you see Community here it replaced it with the upgrade keyword which is exactly what we wanted we now have that action we're mounting that new modal and then we're opening it in a single one shot prompt with three words we've replaced writing this entire if block it might seem like a small Advantage but over the course of an entire day of engineering an entire week you can see how this type of Rapid use of our AI coding assistant will Stack Up massively over the long term aot allowing you to do much more in less time let's look at another example of how we can use the mirror keyword here's another logical hook that lets us operate on table definitions you can see here we have a simple computed property that is just returning all the names of our tables let's go ahead and create a new property called column names we'll do the exact same thing using our mirror keyword so we'll come in here and we'll say column names mirror table names and just so our AI coding system has the context of our types we're going to add a reference to that file and so our table definitions is inside of render types and we'll just make sure that that is available to our coding assistant inside this prompt we'll hit generate perfect and you can see here it generated a 2d array for each table we have a list of the column names mirror is a very very powerful keyword you can use it to duplicate existing patterns variables functions and and even entire files so let's move on to our second keyword variable a massive component of programming is creating State creating variables being able to create and manipulate variables quickly gives you a massive Advantage as an engineer let's go ahead and flatten our column names and get them out of this 2D array here so to activate the variable keyword we're just going to type const this lets our AI coding assistant know that we wanted to create a variable now the question is what type of variable do we wanted to create so what we'll say is Con flat column names and that's it perfect so just with this single prompt here C flat column names it was able to infer exactly what we wanted the key with this co-pilot prompting keyword is to make sure that you're communicating exactly what you want through your variable name let's look at another example right so we'll go ahead and accept that so let's create another variable we'll say cost flap unique column names just by adding one additional keyword our co-pilot was able to identify that we want a unique set of column names and you can see here this is just coming back as a single list now we'll go ahead and accept this change it's all about communicating exactly what you need to your llm to your AI coding assistant and using the mirror and variable keywords can help you write your code in the blink of an eye I also just want to shout out you know if you're on a massive code bender and you've been you know coding for 30 days straight across hundreds of files it really does help to see variable names like this in an interesting way using AI coding assistance efficiently by prompting exactly what you need by being really detailed with your variable names with your function names it forces us to be more concise and precise without digging into the implementation details so much that really goes along with an idea a kind of principle that we hold on this channel in the age of AI and llms and AI coding assistants we want to be moving up the stack we want to be prompting more we want to be coding less we want to engineer more like a product manager or a ux designer where we have higher level control over what we want to happen versus how it happens tons and tons of code has already been written all the llms have it inside of their training set now it's all about learning to design the right prop and get the results out as quickly as possible and that's what these keywords help you do especially our next keyword but before we move on to the next keyword that's going to add another powerful tool to your co-pilot prompting toolbx I just want to stop and say you know thank you so much for all the support we are nearly at 10K Subs which is absolutely insane for a deep Tech Channel like this where we don't just talk about the latest AI news hype cycle we don't heavily edit on this channel we keep it pretty bare and we really try to avoid heavy clickbait without true follow through there are more than enough channels to do that from the very beginning almost 100 videos ago posting one video every single week I wanted this channel to be different I wanted this channel to be real something that you could go to to learn see what's going on see how you can take action on things right here we think plan and build we aim to use the best tool for the job we dig into concrete examples we use the latest great AI tools like AER and cursor and we use these to build real software right real production grade software faster than ever I just want to say thank you we are betting big on becoming agentic Engineers that use the best AI tooling to build software that build software on our behalf and using AI coding assistant is part of how we get there faster it's part of how we iterate through our products it's part of how we deliver value to our own personal work our own personal tools and of course for our jobs and for our career so anyway I just wanted to kind of you know reiterate what the Channel's all about and I just want to say thank you so much we're almost at 10K Subs it's really incredible to say that we're almost at 10K we'll be here every single week giving away something valuable for your engineering for your engineering career now let's go ahead and talk about the next AI assistant prompt keyword function so just like variables functions are a critical aspect of engineering that enable you to encapsulate blocks of code into reusable modular pieces with AI coding assistants the function keyword gives you the ability to generate entire functions in a fraction of the time let me show you exactly how so just like the variable keyword we're going to start with an endline prompt here with cursor and we're going to write this function out piece by piece detailing exactly what we want to have happen right so I'm going to type function G tables matching string and then I'm I'm going to specify the parameters here so I'm going to say to match and then I'm going to say the type again that's a little redundant but just to be super clear and then I'm also going to specify the return timee right so stir and then as an array right I'm going to kick this off something really important to highlight here just by reading the definition of this function you can essentially guess with really high probability what exactly this is going to do and that is a really really critical aspect of one shot prompting with with your llm can you the engineer writing the prompt know what should happen based on your prompt if the answer is no you should probably rewrite your prompt right but so just like that we wrote this function you know we're going to get tables matching the string so we're looking through this list of table definitions looking at our table names and if our table name includes the string we're going to filter and then we're going to return the table name so this is pretty good and in some cases this is what you would want but what we actually want is we want to return any table that is inside of the string to match and this is going to happen right this is why it's so important that your AI cing assistant can iterate if we h control Z here we can get back into the state where we writing follow-up instructions on this existing line so we can take this function definition and say filter table name is inst to match nice so this is more on the nose we're actually reusing the table names computer property up here and we're returning the table name that is included in the string so we'll accept this change and it's really crucial that the AI coding assistant can iterate because we'll make mistakes it'll make mistakes and we can resolve it just like that so this is really great really powerful let's go ahead and push this a step further let's create another function and add some more details to it right so let's say we want to make sure that our let's say we want to make sure that we don't care about our casing right we can do the exact same thing here and with the function keyword we can actually be more concise so let's say git tables matching string and then we'll also add no case we'll say the same thing string to match we'll specify string and then we'll also just go ahead and specify the return type once again and we are taking a little shortcut here as you saw we're using strr versus string our llm is going to know that it should type out the full string here we were able to compress our oneshot prompt even further by dropping the function and adding some more details into the function definition so that it knows exactly what we're looking for so let's fire this off perfect so exact same deal and it added the two lower case for us if you wanted to you could just iterate directly on this function this is a really really important really Mission critical tool in Your Arsenal as you know writing functions is a huge part of engineering let's push it one step further up till now we've been using gp4 125 for this next example we're going to use what has been shown to be the best inclass model we're going to be using Cloud 3 Opus so it bump the model you might be thinking as we're working through this you know these are really simple function examples you're totally right about that we're still saving a lot of time but these have been kind of simplified more cherry-picked examples right these are all things you can run in you know two or three lines it's definitely giving you a huge speed Improvement let's push our function keyword prompt even further to generate much more complex functionality let's say I want to enhance this function where we're passing in a string to match and returning our table names we want to match table names on a string but we also want to match on individual column names right so just like we did up here we have our column names available so we want to match on that as well and we also want to run a leevin distance on every one of those possible Fields so both our table names and our column names you can think of lene distance as just a way to match how similar a string is so let's go ahead and prompt that out using the function prompt keyword so we'll say G tables matching string and we're just going to leave it with a more simplified name and then we'll specify some parameters here we'll say string to match just like as before we'll specify the return type and then what we'll do is we'll start creating these bullet points where we specify more details about our function right so we'll come in here and we'll say case and sensitive so I'm hitting you know shift enter there to not fire off the prompt yet but add some new lines I'll say also match column names but only return parent tables and then lastly in the things get really powerful I'll say lein distance string one string two and then I'll say distance equals 1 so we're just going to set a default and so let's fire this off let's see how Cloud 3 Opus performs here so it's doing some thinking interestingly it automatically bumped the function name because the previous function name was already taken up here so it's being very context aware and you can see here it is rolling through this it's using this new Lev steene distance function which doesn't exist created that and yeah yeah this looks really really great so it created a brand new L scene distance function and let's just quickly read through this okay nice and it's doing the deletion insertion substitution here and then it's checking the max distance that we're passing in which is going to be one so this is pretty incredible we have a top level function prompt right where we're specifying what exactly we want to happen there's enough information inside the function name the parameter and the return type for our coding assistant to get started we're then specifying details of the function right so we're saying case and so you can see here we have all these lowercase checks perfect we're saying we also want to match on our column names you can see here We're looping through the column names as well which is perfect so it picked up on that type that's great and then it's running the leevin distance which doesn't exist so it sees that it still prototypes the code out and then below Cloud then builds out this Levenstein distance function I've been spending a lot of time pushing these aiing assistance to the Limit seeing how much I can get out of them and these three prompt keywords are a majority of the prompts I'm running right now when I'm using AI coding assistants I wanted to share this with you because there's a ton of value here as you can see when you build out the right prompts when you give it the right context and when you're concise with your prompts not giving it the wrong information not giving it too much or too less information but just what it needs it's able to perform really really well I got to say I've been using and playing around with Claude Opus and it is incredible just like all the benchmarks and just like the llm ecosystem is saying the Opus model is outperforming gbg4 for now we we all know that open AI is coming out with their next Generation model this year so right now CLA 3 Opus is in first place but we know that that's likely to change it's great to see competition with these top- end bottles as we've explored today you know your AI coding assistant is much more powerful than you think it is especially with the keywords mirror variable and function since they offer you powerful shortcuts for engineering tasks they can truly transform the way that you write code these tools not only save you time but enhance our ability to think clearly about Problems by defining variables and functions clearly enough for a coding assistant to understand them which interestingly has this side effect of being more readable for us when Opus created this brand new function name because it saw the conflict here that was a great simple addition right get tables matching string fuzzy that's a legit function name that we would actually use in a production code base right so this is really great L machine distances here really incredible to see that come out of a single prompt coding assistants allows to focus more on designing Solutions rather than getting bogged down by implementation details especially when you're prompting code that's already been written like the line distance your AI coding assistant is going to have that information all you need to do is prompt it the right way there is a really important medium with AI coding assistance let's go ahead and contrl Z back to that prompt there's a really important kind of Middle Ground that you want to hit right if you're typing too much especially when you're writing these shorter functions and you find yourself just writing this like big massive prompt you know three sentences one PA paragraph long prompt it's almost like you should just go ahead and write that code anyway right which you don't want you don't even want to be in that position so using these keywords and there are definitely other keywords that can be utilized here mirror variable and function are just the three that I found to be the most useful in the most use cases and as we discover them I will definitely share them on the channel you want to be in that middle ground where you're giving the llm enough information and enough context to solve your problem but you also don't want to be spending a ton of time prompt engineering and that's where these co-pilot one shop prompt keywords are especially effective so just as a recap use mirror when you want to replicate patterns use the variable keyword with a more verbose name when you want to Define variables and properties and then finally use a function keyword with parameters and with return type in a function prototype like syntax to give you a powerful shortcut for your engineering tasks if you need to push the function keyword even further use the bullet point syntax just like we did here where you can get into this recursive scenario where you can also inside your bullet points Define additional function define additional variables and even use the Mir keyword in here as well I'll see you in the next one where we'll continue to Deep dive into the best AI coding tooling and techniques available that make us better engineers in the age of AI don't forget to like subscribe and hit the notification Bell to stay updated let's blast through 10K Subs stay focused keep building
