  "raw_transcript": "My position is yes, there will be some engineers who don't understand how engineering works that will absolutely lose their roles in the age of AI and frankly many of them probably would have lost their roles previously. One of the interesting things when you work with a lot of different engineers as I have is that you realize how variable the talent mix is across engineers. An engineer at the same level can be worlds apart in terms of actual capability and impact to the business. And anyone who's worked with engineers will tell you the same thing. I had an intern when I worked at Amazon who did more work and delivered more value than senior engineers I knew there. It just was the way it was. He was motivated. He had a great assignment. He was able to get something into production and he did a great job. Needless to say, he got an offer, right? Like the point is that talent is variable. Talent has always been variable.",

    "description": "My site: https://natebjones.com\nMy substack: https://natesnewsletter.substack.com/\nThe story: https://open.substack.com/pub/natesnewsletter/p/software-engineering-isnt-dead-its?r=1z4sm5&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&showWelcomeOnShare=true\n\nTakeaways:\n 1. Engineering Over Code Generation: AI can write code, but engineered systems require invariants, interfaces, safety cases, and reliability under load.\n 2. AI as Force Multiplier: AI democratizes coding, yet chiefly amplifies trained engineers; the real divide shifts from \u201cwho can code\u201d to \u201cwho can engineer.\u201d\n 3. Human Responsibilities Don\u2019t Go Away: Engineers translate intent to specs, convert probabilistic behavior into contracts, reason about emergent effects at scale, and manage latency\u2013quality\u2013cost trade-offs.\n 4. New Disciplines, Same Ethos: Semantic, boundary, memory/knowledge, and safety & assurance engineering emerge to tame injection, drift, context/versioning, and auditability.\n 5. Enduring Human Skills Matter: System intuition, empathy for messy human use, judgment under uncertainty, and orchestration of complex toolchains determine outcomes.\n 6. Demos Aren\u2019t Production: Production demands observability, telemetry, semantic forensics, and design for hostile inputs; \u201cworks once\u201d doesn\u2019t count.\n 7. Three Laws for AI-Era Engineering: 1) No invariants \u2192 not engineered; 2) Not measurable in prod \u2192 not built; 3) Can\u2019t explain failure \u2192 you don\u2019t own it.\n\nQuotes:\n\u201cAI writes code; engineers write invariants, interfaces, and guarantees.\u201d\n\u201cThe divide isn\u2019t who can code\u2014it\u2019s who can engineer.\u201d\n\u201cIf you can\u2019t measure it in production and explain failures, you don\u2019t own the system.\u201d\n\nSummary:\nThis is my love letter to engineering in the age of AI. AI can generate working code, but engineered systems demand invariants, guarantees, and accountability. I argue the divide is shifting from who can code to who can engineer: translate intent into specs, write contracts for probabilistic components, think at scale, and practice economic engineering. New disciplines emerge\u2014semantic, boundary, memory/knowledge, and safety assurance\u2014while timeless skills endure: system intuition, empathy, judgment under uncertainty, and orchestration of complexity. I close with three laws: define invariants, measure in production, and explain failures. Engineers aren\u2019t being replaced; they\u2019re being asked to carry greater responsibility.\n\nKeywords:\nengineering, AI, vibe coding, invariants, probabilistic systems, intent to specification, observability, telemetry, semantic forensics, injection attacks, semantic engineering, boundary engineering, memory engineering, knowledge engineering, safety assurance, model drift, emergent behavior, orchestration, economic engineering, production readiness, accountability, human-in-the-loop, reliability, scale effects, guarantees",
