  "raw_transcript": "We've got clawed code backwards. I am convinced that Anthropic is launching what is effectively a generalurpose AI agent and hiding it under the guise of just being a coding agent. It's not just a coding agent. Clawed code is capable of the full spectrum of intelligence. It just happens to hide in the terminal and that makes it seem scary to people who don't use terminals to code. And let's be honest, that's most of us. What I find really fascinating is that when I started to finally use Claude code, it made the decision to upgrade to like the max tier or whatever for Claude so much easier because at the end of the day, I realized how much more Claude code I could get, how much more time I could get in Claude's UI, and I had enough experience with the intelligence that Claude Code was bringing that it felt intuitive. Let me sort of unpack that. With Claude code, you don't have a traditional development environment. It's not like you are watching the code sort of cascade down necessarily. Claude will edit files. Claude will create files. Claude won't necessarily show you all of it the way it does in the development environment. And you might think, what a terrible design choice. But it turns out that abstracting you above that level helps you to focus with Claude on the strategy and the intent of the project. And that's where I feel like most of the reviews of Claude Code have sort of jumped over and gone straight to the coding power. Look, I get it. Claude Code is powerful. It is good at code. They have done something magical there. I strongly suspect it is because there's not the same token constraints that you would have if you installed Claude in another tool like cursor. And because Enthropic can control the whole experience, they can make Claude code work exactly the way they want. It feels a lot like an internal development tool that got out into the wild, which I believe it is. When you think about it that way, what you realize is a little bit of what senior engineers start to realize after time in the discipline. It's not the ability to write the code that is transformative. It's the ability to think about the structure of the project and how to order it that's useful. I do not claim to be a fantastically experienced senior engineer. My background is different. I am a hacky scrappy founder producty kind of person. Definitely more of a generalist with a strong technical bent. But I know enough about coding and I know enough about project management to see that claude code is so much more than a coding tool and we misunderstand it when we think about it just as a coding tool. As an example, I was messing around with a personal website that I wanted to create. I have not loved my personal website. For those of you that have been there, I freely agree with you. It is terrible. It is awful. It has not been my priority. I've been working on a better one. And I'm not going to let the cat out of the bag in this in this video. We'll save it for another one. The the point is it was so much easier to get Claude Code to work on this project than it was in any other environment. I'd played with it in. I tried Windsurf. I'd played with it in cursor a little bit. Played with it in 03, which was the worst example of the lot. Look, I like 03. I've said a lot of nice things about it, but 03 as a straight code in 03 environment, I don't love. Claude code was easy because Claude answered my questions intelligently. Claude laid out a plan I could understand. And when Claude decided to build, it built largely correctly from the start. There was minimal adjustment I needed to make. All I had to do was tell Claude what I was looking to build a personal site, give Claude some style guidance, and ask Claude to answer first with a plan, which it's already inclined to do, and then work up with Claude to refine the plan. This all happened in plain English. Yes, it's a terminal. Don't let that scare you. The terminal is just a chatbot experience. It's not that scary. And this is for folks who are not engineers. If you're an engineer, the terminal is not going to scare you anyway. The point is that we misunderstand cla code if we think it's just for coding. I had an entire effectively product requirements document for my website created back and forth by discussing with cloud code what I wanted in great detail and I noticed some wrinkles that have held true with other sort of vibe coding projects that I wanted to specifically underline here because they're different from what you might see in traditional engineering projects. In traditional engineering projects, you always put the bones or the wireframe together first. That's why a lot of our agile development timeline is like do the wireframe, see if the wireframe works, then maybe we add some detail and we get to midfies and then eventually high-fives and then we code it. No, you are coding right from the beginning when you prototype, which is true of most vibe coding things. And specifically, you are looking to code for polish initially before you code the back end. That's very unintuitive to me, but it works well with these vibe coding projects because it's hard to introduce UX and design polish later. It is much easier to introduce it earlier. So, take the time to get the polish right. This is the first time using clawed code is the first time that I have been able to actually get a polished professional midlooking AI. Uh, and I'll put some screenshots kind of what I was playing with uh, in the substack. But at the end of the day, the way I got there was 80% clawed code and then the other 20% was actually a mixture of 03 and CLY. And I don't know if anyone has done that workflow before. Please tell me if I'm wrong, but what I did was I took Cluey as a coding screenshotter. Like I didn't have to take screenshots and trade them around. You can't really put screenshots directly into Claude Code. I was looking for a way to get specific feedback of what I was seeing in the UI easily into Claude Code's hands. And so I basically had Cle pen visualized UX that I had and I was like, look, I don't like the button highlights. I think the button highlights are kind of grimy and icky. I don't think they pop the way they need to. They're too low light. I need it to pop more. and Cluey responded with code that would fix it from a CSS perspective. And I did not care if Clo was right. I've talked in previous videos about the fact that I think Clo has kind of a mid AI. And so I didn't care if it was correct about the code. I cared that it could describe the change approximately in code. And then I could take that and I piped it a little bit over to 03 to do some research on color, which is weird, right? Using 03 to do research on color, but I did. And then when I felt like I had a sense of like the right color I wanted for the front end and kind of the theme and then I also had a sense of like the code and how to adjust it for particular elements like buttons and frames. Then I went back to claude code and I didn't give it a screenshot. I gave it this is a code snippet. This is a color and then I asked it to be intelligent. Again we're operating above the level of just coding agent. It feels like a general purpose agent. I said think about this consider it and make the appropriate changes. And then I could easily cycle back the HTML, the CSS, and the JavaScript into CodePen to visualize the front end and say, \"Is it good? Is it not good? Do I want changes?\" And I could mess with it until I had it exactly the way I wanted. And then I said, \"Okay, we're finally ready. Proceed with building the site.\" And then Claude Code proceeded with building it locally. And then it's a matter of like build it locally, do the deployment, all the other sort of usual development stuff. But I did all of the general purpose agent stuff, the requirements development, really the design inside Claude Code 2. And the only thing stopping people from using it, I think, is the fear of using a terminal. And I think it will help if you think about the terminal as effectively a chatbot that can talk to the files on your computer. That's really it. And I know that there are ways that you can sort of MCP your way other places as well, and that's great. And I know that Claude code can go out and search the internet. I had it do that during part of the conversation. But if you just think about it from a simple perspective as you know what here's claude code it's just another chatbot. It happens to live in a terminal and I can talk to it. Maybe that gets you over the fear if you're not an engineer. If you are an engineer I would encourage you when you're sharing about your cloud code projects. Yes. talk about how amazing Cloud is where it illustrates the token burn and it's really smart at actually executing what you want and it has a high follow through. You can talk about the caveats and the drawbacks in certain situations. It is unfortunate that you can't see the code that you're writing, right? I'm not saying it replaces everything. But also mention if you're an engineer or you're a regular user of cloud code that this is not just a coding agent. It is more than that. It is effectively a general purpose agent that lives in your terminal. And I think it's an interesting model for where AI agents are going in the future. So that's my introduction to Claude Code. I hope you enjoy it. It is not hard to get Claude Code on your computer. It is like a twominute install. Super easy. It's like one terminal command. You just follow the instructions and you'll be up and running. It's not scary at all. If you have a Claude account, it's super super fast. So Claude didn't pay me to do this. I'm just doing this because I like Claude code and I think more people need to understand it's not just a coding agent. Tears.",

    "description": "My site: https://natebjones.com/\nMy links: https://linktr.ee/natebjones\nMy substack: https://natesnewsletter.substack.com/\n\nTakeaways\n 1. Claude Code \u2260 \u201cJust Coding\u201d: It functions as a full-spectrum, general-purpose AI agent that happens to live in the terminal, guiding everything from strategy to deployment.\n 2. Terminal as Chatbot: Treat the CLI like any other chat UI\u2014once you do, the intimidation factor disappears and non-engineers can tap the same power.\n 3. Plan Before You Type: Claude Code\u2019s strength is in shaping project architecture and intent up-front, letting you think like a senior engineer instead of obsessing over syntax.\n 4. Prototype Polish First: With vibe-coding projects, front-end polish comes early; Claude Code makes high-fidelity prototypes fast, shrinking the gap between idea and professional look.\n 5. Workflow Synergy: Combining Cluely for quick visual feedback and O3 for color research, then looping back to Claude Code, creates a nimble, multi-agent build pipeline.\n 6. Easy Upsell: Experiencing Claude Code\u2019s depth made upgrading to Claude\u2019s highest tier a no-brainer because the added context windows and time unlock even more capability.\n\nQuotes\n\u201cWe keep calling it a coding agent, but Claude Code is really a general-purpose agent hiding in a terminal suit.\u201d\n\u201cAbstracting away the cascade of code forces me to focus on the architecture\u2014and that\u2019s where the real leverage is.\u201d\n\u201cIf you think of the terminal as a chatbot that can touch your files, the fear melts and the magic shows up.\u201d\n\nSummary\nI argue that Claude Code isn\u2019t merely a coding assistant; it\u2019s a general-purpose agent disguised as a terminal tool. By abstracting code details, it pushes me to think strategically, shaping requirements and design before writing a single line. Installing it took one command, and the experience instantly justified paying for Claude\u2019s max tier. Using Claude Code alongside Cluely for UI critiques and O3 for color research, I iterated a polished personal site faster than any other setup. The key lesson: prototype polish early, treat the CLI as just another chat window, and embrace Claude Code\u2019s agent-level intelligence.\n\nKeywords\nClaude Code, Anthropic, general purpose agent, terminal AI, vibe coding, project architecture, UX polish, Cluely, O3, prototyping, AI workflow, installation",
