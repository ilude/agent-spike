  "raw_transcript": "your code is the most blunt multiplier on your productivity as an engineer if you can code five times faster you're 5x engineer simple right normally you increase your coding output through writing and reading code over days months and years but all that is about the change and you and I know exactly why imagine if you had a tool that enabled you to build websites servers CLI tools and any type of application 5x faster in just a couple of weeks or days this is the promise of AI coding assistants AI coding assistants are the largest multiplier on on our productivity to ever exist you can see here in this simple coding example I created a brand new function with two prompts ran the code and it successfully ran no issues at all shout out to AER shout out to AI quoting assistants shout out to the great llm technology that's upon all of us today it's incredible Tech with tons of potential but you may have noticed AI coding assistants haven't really taken off yet why is that the world is built on code so those writing 5x clean code should be winning right why haven't AI cing assistance really taken off yet that's because there are big problems with AI coding assistants right now and one massive hidden cost no one's talking about and maybe no one will talk about except for us on this channel right now let's dig into what's missing from the current AI coding experience and discuss the big reasons why it's critically important to keep a sharp eye on the AI coding assistant space let's quick run this test let's start by answering a simple question what is an a a coding assistant so I want to make it absolutely clear and set some standards for True AI coding assistants I'm talking about boots on the ground software that junior plus Engineers can use to create read update and delete code if you can't run crud on your code it's not an AI coding assistant it's not a true AI coding assistant so let's run through some examples there are things like GPT engineer chat Dev crew AI autogen cursor and there are things like AER right so let's use these as examples so which one of these are true AI coding assistants and which ones are not so we have crew Ai and autogen which are building blocks that can modify code if directed to these are building blocks that allow you to build multi-agent systems that solve problems on your behalf we've gone in depth into autogen in the past this is really powerful technology but this is not a standalone true AI coding assistant we then have gbt engineer and chat Dev agent gbt you've heard a lot of these These are fun tools they get a lot of coverage in the AI Tech news hype cycle but always end up losing steam these tools don't meet the standard for what a true AI coding assistant is so what is the standard right let's set some standards what is the standard for True AI coding assistance okay let's talk about this true AI coding assistance must meet these three attributes to be useful for Value creating Engineers so let's dive into these if you've used AI coding assistant definitely let me know if you agree with these three standards they must work on existing code bases they must have a file context mechanism we'll dig into what exactly that is in a second and they must be iteratively controllable okay so let's break these down right so must work on existing code bases if the tool doesn't work on existing code bases and can only spin up new apps or new prototypes it's not a true AI coding assistant right this is where a lot of the cool flashy tools fall out of the race right a lot of the gbt engineers chat Dev star gbt and and please correct me if I'm wrong in the comments but these are not built to be true AI coding assistants writing code on arbitrary code bases at any time any anywhere let's talk about the second standard they must have a file context mechanism so if files cannot be referenced in your coding promps you're limited to editing a single file and it's quite obvious when you say this out loud but you cannot build anything substantial with just a single file the AI assistant must look at relevant files to satisfy your prompt in order to be a true AI coding assistant it must be iteratively controllable a lot of tools follow the race here as well AI coding assistants are going to get things wrong just just like you and I get things wrong but how do we correct it we iterate our AI coding assistants must be able to iterate as well they need some type of conversation thread some type of memory of things that have happened of errors that they have made so that they can correct them right if you cannot iterate from Bad Code to good code from buggy code to running code we have to disqualify the tool this is critical for the coding experience iteration is at the center of great engineering great design and great product devel development now that we have a solid standard for what a coding ASN is let's talk about problems so let's look at these problems through the lens of what I consider to be the best two AI coding assistants right now let me go and just jot these down so best to AI coding assistance in 2024 Jan many of you already know it's going to be cursor and on top of that it's going to be a so let's look at some of these problems through these AI coding assistants so there are five massive problems blocking AI coding assistant from giving us massive 5x level value as Engineers let's talk about what exactly they are so just top to bottom five big problems with AI coding assistant file management accuracy speed security and then lastly we're going to talk about the big ticket item that no one's talking about and that technology tends to always bring with it this is going to be a really big hitter we're going to talk about this at the end let's first break down these five issues let's open up uh let's open up cursor okay so same codebase we're here in cursor so if you're not aware cursor is an AI first code editor basically it's a fork of vs code with some really crucial features that allow AIP programming right in the application this application right now is at the top of their game in my opinion they are definitely threatened by all the work that's happening right now with get co-pilot I think that they're in the race for now we'll see how that progresses huge shout out to the cursor does let's keep working here so let's talk about file management a big problem with AI coding assistance is file management in cursor we can select everything we can hit command K and then we can start editing our code right let's drop down the gbg 3.5 Just For Speed right now in order to get the full context of your code base in order to accurately add context to what you want to add to your prompt you need to be able to reference files first who does this with this at symbol and then you can reference your files code documentation and other things we're just going to do at and then we're going to say test. test.ts and now we've added the context of our test file and so now we can see this here now our AI coding assistant can make edits to the index.ts file with the knowledge of the test. test.ts file and it's best to do this the opposite way so let's open up the test file let's highlight everything here and then let's add and x. TS as a reference and now let's say now we can you know kind of browse through this file which is really cool now let's go ahead and add the test for the other function right prefix files endur let's go ahead and say ADD test for this okay this is GPT 3. 5 let's see how it does so you can see there it added the file it's going line by line so it looks like all we have right now is this single line change let's add a follow-up instruction this Taps into standard number three that I mentioned it must be iterative you can see here Cur person did not actually create the test all it did was add this so what we're going to do here is add a follow-up instruction write the test so now you can see it's adding and now when I explicitly said in a follow-up command write the test it went ahead it's written the test it added a little bit of junk here that's fine I'm going to hit accept and you can see here I'll remove this it's got the test let's open up Bun we'll run test on test. test.ts we'll run it and you can see here successfully the AI coding assistant wrote the test for us previously without the AI coding assistant I would do this by hand maybe try to copy over some of the previous code with AI coding assistant I did absolutely nothing I wrote two semi sentences that detailed what needed to happen one prompt and a follow-up prompt using gbt 3.5 if you use gbt 4 I'll bet you that would have one shotted this is file management right and why is this a problem because look at what I just had to do right I'm only operating in two files you you reference the entire file and then you hit add and you have to individually add every file that's relevant to completing this prompt if you have a file that has 5 10 20 Imports that's going to get really crazy right The Big Race for a lot of these AI coding assistants is can they manage your files properly can they reference the files you need in every single prompt file management is one of the biggest problems of AI code assistance right now so what's the second problem right the second problem is accuracy um just as you saw we had an issue there with the gbt 3.5 model it just kind of went through and it didn't complete the code I can you know keep prompting and you know kind of force an error here but I think you get the point these gpts these AI coding assistants they're still error prone and basically you know if you're using gp4 you can expect one in every maybe five generations will just be straight up wrong this is this is a combination of learning how to prompt properly and adding reference files but it's also just a limitation of the strength of the models against the complexity of the task you're trying to accomplish right we'll talk about solutions to these problems in just a moment here but let's look at speed next right so speed isn't a hard blocker but it definitely is something that you have to consider right the reason I switched over to the GPT model and cursor here so if we highlight everything we go back to GPT 4 and we run a prompt add another test for add to files Ender right so if we do this look at how much slower gbg4 is so not too bad this is actually running a lot faster than normal uh I am filming this on a Saturday morning normally uh this is going to be a lot slower especially using the top end model here it looks like it's breezing through this pretty quickly which is awesome okay nice so it looks like it created a another test there let's go ahead and accept that let's take a look at what's going on there should not change file content if empty string is appended sure let's go ahead and test that out cool so that passed perfectly you can see there that took a little bit of time that wasn't a huge thing again I'm not going to harp on this too long speed is not a blocker it's just an annoyance but since gp4 is the best model we have to wait to get the best results for now in both cursor and AER we can see how slow this process is compared to gpg 3.5 the big issue here is that every prompt has to hit their API right this is kind of an unprecedented piece of technology where we're doing so many requests and it's always hitting their API and you know if you use something like cursor if you use something like ader you don't really know unless you can see the internal code what is happening how many prompts are actually firing off so it's definitely important to monitor costs there okay let's talk about security real quick I'm not going to harp on this too long either security is something that just is comes along with the package right now just because we're relying on gbg4 turbo and a third party application you know basically any tool any AI cing assistant that's going to be good you're going to have to just kind of commit to the risk of using their API your code's likely going to be uploaded you know cursor has this uh setting here where you can explicitly say you know privacy mode I have it enabled here I probably don't need to do that for this particular for this particular test code base but I have it on by default you know privacy especially if working on proprietary software I totally understand people not wanting to you know enable and just ship off their code to whoever AI coding assistant is watching and listening I think there's a big concern that you know GI up co-pilot is doing that a lot right now and it's just basically kind of reading up everyone's code and you know doing who knows what with it on the back end so something to think about security is definitely a problem of AI coding assistance I think it's really clear in the minds of everyone using models for everything the ideal scenario is to have a GPT 4 Turbo level assistant right on your device I think we're probably one probably two or 3 years away from having that on device unless open AI innovates really hard to create create a highly you know uh encrypted on device model that would be really clutch I would love to see that product come out honestly I think they would make so much money and you know Engineers product Builders would really love just a clean highly efficient really fast on device model but again those are limitations of the technology that we're facing today they are just things that we can't do yet we're still all working on getting these llms to be faster smaller more efficient more accurate Etc so security is another problem and then a hidden problem that I don't think anyone's really talking about let's talk about this this one is really unique this is skill atrophy so any new great technology helps us do things we know how to do faster and better but this always comes at a cost right we always have to pay this cost okay what's the cost of receiving a 5x tool that allows you to get somewhere that would normally take you years years to get the cost is just like using Google Maps before you knew exactly how to drive to your friends your families the store whatever now with Google Maps with Apple Maps with this technology you just turn on directions you don't think about where you're going anymore you just do what your assistant what Google Maps is telling you to do you just look and drive it's faster there's less mental overhead it's more accurate than you because it can analyze the traffic it's got some crazy AAR algo that it's running to get you there in no time right but that all comes at a cost no one's thinking about how they got to where they are and the same problem arises with AI coding assistance I have found as I continue to use as I continue to improve my prompting abilities I am thinking less about code and I'm thinking more about the high level problem that's a good thing don't get me wrong that's a great thing right as I mentioned in the 2024 predictions video I think great Engineers are going to be moving up the stat focus more on product Less on code right you know how to solve the problem so you prompt it the job is done move on to the next thing right but that comes at a cost as we use this technology we're not going to be getting in the hard reps of building of writing code of having your boots on the ground digging into the complexities the annoyances the beauty of coding that's all slowly going to be prompted away skill atrophy is something that is serious and it's likely going to fly overhead but as you use AI coding assistance you'll really start to really internalize this idea right you'll you'll think back to this video and think yeah I am slowly you know losing a couple of my chops you know it's not going to happen all once it's not like you use a coding assistant for like 6 months and you just can't code anymore but you know extend that time to you know 3 years and you're using this really efficiently just like I have I think you'll see that I think other Engineers will see that as well but this is just the cost of great technology right okay so let's move on so those are the issues right these are the five big issues right now with AI coding assistant really it comes down to the these you know some combination of these top four are the big big problem right with file management being the biggest one I think by far and then it trails with accuracy speed let's talk about some of the solutions right so what are people doing to get around this what are Engineers building how can we get around file issues accuracy issues speed issues security are there Solutions potential Solutions so you know let's talk about file management so what do we have with file management so we have explicit file context uh manual add remove file context and this is best shown via AER right right now I only have the index at TS file I can look at how many tokens that costs I can see you know how much that's chewing up looks like basically nothing I can drop that I can add the test file right then I can read the index file and basically this is the process for adding and removing files right now in the top tier AI coding assistants right you do it manually essentially and some of these tools are getting better at trying to guess what you need need I found it really hard to rely on these over hundreds and hundreds of files right so basically that's the main solution right now file management and then you know we're just going to wait for tools to improve right so I don't like you know waiting for solutions to come out but sometimes that's the best thing to do right just sit and wait maybe you try to build some poc's to see and investigate how you can improve it a little bit basically you just sit and wait right I found that the whole you know rag similarity search across the entire code base does not end up working very well um so the explicit add and removal you know just like we have here cursor has its own version just like I mentioned before you you know add symbol you have files and then you can just specifically reference the files this is good for now you can get a lot of value out of this I do want to quick call out this cool plugin for AER that was built that basically watches the open files that you have so you can just do um open AER whatever AER command you have and you can see here if I close test. test it automatically removes that for my context so I found this to be really useful I'm using this a lot right now I'll link it in the description so you can check that out if you're interested but this is super useful I think I think this is a really simple idea that gets a you know 80% of the value if AI coding assistants just look at the open files that you have since that is really the natural flow of things anyone that's watching any you know anyone from the cursor team or Microsoft anyone watching I would spend some time here because really quickly I'm able to add and remove the files that I'm actually working on which are exactly the files that I would want to prompt right really simple brilliant solution by um people surrounding the AER ecosystem a lot of good stuff happening around there in regards to AI coding assistance so let's move on let's file management right so wait for the files to improve look for Niche open file context right so good stuff there let's talk about accuracy so wait for tools to improve uh that's definitely just the right thing to do here but also I would say practice you need to be getting your reps in I've beaten this idea over the head in the channel the prompt is the new fundamental unit of Technology I'm just going to write that down the prompt is the new fundamental unit of programming if you're not studying and learning The Prompt just like you have your data structures if Loops for Loops you're going to be falling behind this year I'm just saying it like it is the prompt is the new fundamental unit of programming start prompting your code write less code prompt more practice is a huge part of that since we're on the topic if you're watching this and you're thinking I have no idea how to get started with AI coding assistants or I'm not sure how to progress with AI coding assistants and you really want to learn drop a comment down below I've been thinking about AI coding assistant tutorials and potentially courses to help Engineers catapulter engineering to that 5x level into the future of AI engineering I want to help you capture those 5x coding assistant gains in the smallest amount of time so if you're interested in that let me know in the comments I think that's something that's definitely worth spending time on so let's keep moving so what do we do about speed uh this is definitely just a kind of weight for tools to improve but I also want to call out this idea of experiment and see if you really need gbt for Turbo or if gbg3 is enough right so this is something where experimenting with your prompts experimenting with different models I would definitely say don't try to test out local models to do real programming work right now they're just too far behind but definitely experiment with gbt 4 versus gpt3 there are a lot of prompts and a lot of work that can be done with gpt3 you know you saw it earlier I use cursor to ship a GPT 3.5 prompt and it worked perfectly right so definitely experiment there talk about security use a local Only Solution this is kind of like in the future because none of them can keep up but I think here we're just kind of waiting for great local llms to catch up right so kind of just this is the same thing this is nothing new I'm not sure if there's a real solution for security right now other than you know bite the bullet and use uh a Cloud solution right and last probably the most difficult to really address pay close attention to the results of your prompts we're naturally going to be moving up the stack great technology always deprecates jobs skills and entire Industries but I I I think the the key is to you know don't fight this too much focus on the bigger picture The Prompt right I think I think this is really the key right focus on the new tool focus on the power of the new tool don't fight this too much you know maybe you're like digging into like leak code or something like that to keep your skill up that's fine I would honestly just be really focused on generating the most value from The Prompt this is it is the the new fundamental unit of programming I would also say it's the the new standard the new Baseline of what companies are going to be expecting of Engineers like if you can't prompt some code you're not getting hired right I think that's going to be a true reality within the next 5 years it's going to be you know okay prompt me some code how would you write this prompt how would you tweak this prompt to reference the 2024 predictions video once again I think prompts will really take off and really start to take up concrete roles and we'll know that when we start seeing prompt related interview questions show up in interviews so I think that's going to be happening I wouldn't focus on this too much just kind of you know flow flow with the AI yeah don't fight it um it's funny that uh get up co-pilot is giving me that correction here um there's probably something to be said about that but we're just going to move on so you know those are the current Solutions those are the current problems that I see and you know some potential Solutions I would definitely Focus here and um you know let's just wrap up let's talk about you know why do we care about about AI coding I think it's obvious if you made it this part this video it's probably obvious right um whoever cracks the puzzle is going to catapult into the future of engineering right like we discussed let's write this out right let's be really explicit so why care about AI coding assistance right so uh whoever cracks this puzzle is going to catapult into the future of engineering the world is built on code and yeah whoever can build the best code will the fastest will win in the long run right basically you're writing more code you're getting more iterations in you're write You're Building more products You're Building better products and it's really just a Ras to the top on a micro on a personal level if you're faster you can build more once you finish your work you can work work more or um relax more it's it's it's it's pretty straightforward you know speed means you can do more if you can do more that means you have optionality you can finish your work you can work more you can build other things you can take it to the next level or you can just chill and relax right not everything has to be hustle not everything has to be grind last thing I want to touch on here you know follow this channel follow other value Centric channels to curate the best information so you can take actions on the trends that can seriously impact your life right like AI coding assistants they're just getting started started there's massive value here for us to unlock over the long run I'm going to be covering them on the channel just like I have been for over half a year now we're just getting started I am optimistic that all of these key problems and more will be solved by you know a lot of the great engineering that's happening right now on AER cursor and other applications I'm kind of shocked at how slow the AI programming space is moving maybe we're really ahead of the curve here on the channel getting into it early eating up a lot of the value before anyone else is getting there but you know I'm I'm pretty pretty shocked at how slowly people are moving on this stuff so you know definitely join the journey in the comments let me know if you're interested in some type of like AI coding assistant focused tutorials I can definitely do that I would love to give value in that way I'm really amped on this technology and I use it on a daily basis right I am fully moving toward that full agentic engineering experience where I am prompting AI agents are writing the code for me and I'm getting way more done way faster my engineering from today and from you know even just 2 years ago is night and day different and I want you to experience those gains as well so you know huge thanks for watching drop any comments you have any questions any concerns you know if you think there are other big problems with the ad coding assistants definitely let me know I'd love to hear your thoughts huge thanks for watching especially if you made it to the end you know drop the like drop the sub I'll see you in the next one stay focused and keep building",
