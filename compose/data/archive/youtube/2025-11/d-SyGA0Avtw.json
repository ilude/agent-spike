  "raw_transcript": "what's up Engineers Indy Dev Dan here I have a special video for you today this is a Hands-On nobs AI coding Dev log using CLA code and the model context protocol I have never adopted a tool faster than I've adopted Cloud code there is nothing more important going on right now for True software engineering and in the Gen AI age then CLA code and mCP in this video I'll show why that's true so we're going to boot up claw code but we're not going to prematurely jump in here and start firing off prompts iteratively that's the old 2024 way to do things first thing we need to do is gather all the context and information we need to run claw code in its true agentic form to do this we're going to use a tool called repo mix repo mix allows us to read entire code bases and collapse them into a single file that we can use as context for our AI tooling for CLA code AI coding tools llms they love patterns they love pre-existing information so that's what we're going to do here we're going to clone the model context protocol servers GitHub repository and then we're going to look at a specific example that we can pull from so we're going to look at git here and so we're going to CD into the git directory and you know we can see there's the structure we can run LS and tree to kind of understand the high Lev structure and then we can run repo mix so repo mix allows us to take this code base and collapse it into a single file you can see we have 30k tokens there and now we're just going to move this into our code base right so I'm going to get the path to our current codebase run that and then move this into the um AI doc directory you may have seen this throughout some of the code bases that I work on maybe you have your own pattern for this um this is super important for just organizing information that your AI tooling can reference all right so there's that we now have the uh mCP server for git and now we can use this is a you know key guiding example a key guiding structure for our new tool that we're building our new mCP server that we're going to build in this video called pocket pick so there's that now we're going to do something super super important we're going to create a spec we're going to create a plan so before we dive into what this plan is all about um I'm curious what you think comment down below let me know what you think is a more important release model context protocol or CLA code I feel like these are two massively game-changing tools let me know which tool you're using the most are you fully on board with CLA code and are you fully on board with mCP servers I've been holding off trying to wait to you know understand the landscape of the model context protocol there are of course risks associated with committing to a technology like this but I think and ropic is doing it in such a way that it makes sense it's open source it's public anyone can build these this is turning out to be the standard for building AI agents for building AI tools as you'll see in this video you can quickly build your own mCP servers so what are we building and what is the spec right what is the spec prompt what is this what is this plan that we're building so we are building pocket pick this is your personal knowledge base for reusability of ideas patterns and code Snippets this is something that we started building out in lesson 8 of principled AI coding and what we're going to do here in this video is use CLA code in its true agentic coding form to build out a full version of this built completely on mCP so this is something different I've been waiting to pull the trigger on this we're going to build this tool as an mCP server first so there will be no other way to interact with this tool other than mCP I think this is going to be the direction things will go as mCP grows and develops so pocket pick is all about quickly being able to save and then reference ideas patterns and code stimits for your engineering work we're setting up the project structure so quite literally the directory structure of this new tool just above you can see the simple pocket pick SQL light table structure um I love when I can boil down data structures to just the essentials we have ID created text and tags right this is all we need to create a great first version of our personal knowledge base of our pocket piics and so you know you might be asking why are we building out this plan why aren't we just starting to prompt right cuz I can guarantee you that if you're writing prompts iteratively you are not doing as much as you can and you're not scaling in your impact as much as you could be and in this video you'll see exactly what I mean I'm creating that classic implementation notes section this is where you just basically write ad hoc information it's where you work through things it's kind of the catchall section we're doing some API based design here a great way to communicate information to your AI coding tools is to create the interface in which you would use to operate with it so what we're doing here is creating a CLI based API design right and and this will very clearly communicate to our AI coding assistant what we want the API to look like you can see here I'm using cursor tab as well to help me you know quickly create this spec prompt I think the tech ecosystem has a massive problem in thinking that there are best tools right and thinking you know uh what's the best tool what's the best a coding tool I can use is it cursor is it CLA code is it AER Devon what's the best tool right I just want to use the best tool I think this is a very limiting mindset because it forces you to always think in competition right it forces you to think in Winner Takes all the world is not Winner Takes all at least not our world right we don't have to pick one we can pick multiple the real question we should ask is what combination of tools gives me the best results in the least amount of time with the fewest trade-offs right we're Engineers our work is all about tradeoffs right we're balancing tradeoffs it doesn't matter what AI technology you're using there will always be a tradeoff the best Engineers know when to make the right tradeoffs so I think in ANS not ores I use you know claw code I use cursor tab I use AER right there there's a time in place for all these tools and you know just to like you know address the elephant in the room that is CLA code um this tool does change things like I mentioned you know um in combination with mCP this tool is a must have for engineers uh moving forward specifically some powerful mCP host and you know your own personal set of mCP servers this is just going to be the way things are moving this this this information set this tool set has caught fire we'll talk about AER and Cloud code more in the future I'm continuing to build out the project structure and as you can see here we're using information dense keywords we're using the mirror keyword if you've taken principal AI coding you know exactly how powerful that is and what this means this is really cool so I'm basically treating every file inside of our project structure as a prompt right so you can communicate additional information um by using some simple nesting structure like this right so you can see here I'm adding a new pantic type in the data types file I'm detailing that we want that default database path and then here we're going to use one of my favorite patterns dot dot dot this is one of my all-time favorite information Den keywords dot dot dot tells your a coning assistant continue right keep going with the pattern right fill in the blanks feel free to pause the video there um this is something we talk about uh in principal a coding but just by typing that dot dot dot there our AI coding assistant knows to create the other pantic types filling in some more implementation notes here you know nothing super crazy nothing super new happening here and we're just working through everything that we want done here right so we're referencing our documentation uh we're saying that we want all of our tags to be lowercase and now we're looking at the mCP git server we want to see the dependencies it has right I want to make sure that I'm covering the dependencies we also want pie test we're going to need this for closed loop self validation and of course SQL light 3 this is built in so I'm going to make sure that I mention that okay and I'm telling the you know I'm I'm telling Cloud code um how to run things right and so just adding some more implementation notes Here I definitely could have ADD added some of these inside of the uh project structure um but it's important to not overthink things too much you just want to have the information visible to your AI coding tool right keep things simple now we're doing something really really important again principal AI coding members know why this is so important um we're closing the loop here by telling our language model how to validate itself so we're working through here we almost have a final version we're going to make one tweak to our plan and and you know you you may be like holy crap you haven't done anything yet you know we spent 10 minutes writing this plan um that's right we have and you're going to see why and how powerful it is in just a moment here and so as I was working through this I realized that I don't think I had enough information to complete the work needed for the find command and now that I'm playing this back I'm actually I actually completely uh write this incorrectly so I'm using Pocket ad instead of pocket find so you know there's just a glaring mistake there we'll see if our AI coding assistant picks up on my mistake or automatically corrects it for me so there we go now we're back in CLA code and now it's time to fire off CLA code so we now have our plan now it's time to watch our upfront investment pay off so I'm going to Prime Cloud code this is a really important kind of new paradigm I'm saying read these files then implement the plan right so you can see as per request it's reading those files and then it's going to read you know there go reading the project at taml right it's understanding the entire uh project structure and now it's going to read the plan right so there it goes now it wants to start working so you know if you've used Cloud code you know what's going to happen next we're going to turn on YOLO mode I don't want it to ask for permission all the time I wanted to get the work done in the most agentic fashion possible so here we go this is the incredible part like subscribe comment if you know what's going going to happen next year right so we wrote out this comprehensive plan and look at what's happening look at what's happening on the left files content um code it's getting generated right we wrote the plan we outlined the directory structure we used idks to communicate a lot of information and check this out add got created F got created list tags got created list got created removed just got generated right this is a different way of engineering this is the next phase in AI coding we're moving from AI coding to a gentic coding great planning is now great prompting okay this is a paradigm shift in how code gets created our AI coding assistant understands what we want because we spent The Upfront investment right these are not oneoff ad hoc prompts right Claud Cod doesn't need to read write read right read right we gave it a big picture as if our product manager or lead engineer uh you know wrote up a very very powerful comprehensive you know ticket or plan for you to build something right that's the way to think about writing great spec prompts so you can see here dependencies right uh it's all getting added here and now it knows we're operating in UV it's asking to install we say yes of course and things are happening right things are just happening um I actually enter in the wrong command here but it doesn't end up uh mattering too much and there we go uh tests right tests are getting generated and you know it's all just happening you know it's it's just we set things up we invested and now our tooling is doing the work for us okay so Claude is suggesting the wrong command so I'm just going to remind it I'm saying UV runp test remember I'm kind of triggering it to run a needle in the Hast stack uh test against the plan right because I did mention that expensively in the implementation notes I said use UV runp test so something I noticed here it's running test that's great it's self validating it's awesome but I notied we're missing a ton of tests right we only have test ad and test test a knit we need full test coverage I don't want to know that part of the codebase works I want to know that all of it works I'm just running a follow-up prompt and you can see here in the functionality test uh we are just missing test it only has a knit and test ad so um I mentioned that to clog code and now it's going to blaze through all the missing tests right clog code is fantastic this is one of the best agentic coding tools uh to date a tool like this a tool that's powerful forces you to rethink how you're building it forces you to consider that this is a paradigm shift that this is a new way of engineering and it is it is I have access to three clawed you know API tokens across different teams and I can tell you I've spent hundreds of dollars on cloud code already that number is only going to go up when we talk about trade-offs when we talk about AER versus Cloud code and Cloud code versus really anything this tool is going to cost you this thing is a token gobbler I know some Engineers have talked about Klein and other agentic tools you know chune through tokens Cloud code is no different everything must come through the context window okay so this is fantastic we just ran that help command and you can see everything looks like it passed properly plug code is reporting success if we run/ cost you can see exactly what I'm talking about there that session right those three and really one prompt cost $2 to run okay so this is not cheap technology right we are talking when you're writing these big powerful spec prompts we are talking dollars per prompt right and this is nowhere near the largest spec prompt I've created okay so you can imagine as you scale this up as you hand off more of your work as you create these more powerful precise packages for your AI tooling those costs these numbers go up right right and I do want to quickly mention this is something we talk about in Lesson Four of principal AI coding you want to be spending money to save time you know as long as the costs are worth it I absolutely recommend using tool like this using other tools that let you scale up your computer right now we're doing the review process okay so we're reviewing we're validating we're making sure that um you know no matter how great these tools get it's always going to just take a pass through the code to make sure it looks good so that's what I'm doing right now we walking through our brand new pocket pick mCP server functionality so it all looks good and what I'm going to do now is just understand how much impact I just had so I'm going to remove the lock file stage these current files and then run uh get diff head stat so you can see there 1,600 lines 1,600 lines of code created from a I think we have a 100 line uh prompt right about 1,000 tokens okay so you know just looking at it from a point blank perspective I just 16 xed my impact right I multiplied what I could do by 16x not considering any complications not considering any of the time it takes to actually write the code that's just on a perline basis okay really it's more like a 30 or 40 or 50x because it takes time to think through and test all this code right and we just packaged it we created a great package we created a great plan and what did we do we handed it off to our AI tooling we handed it off to our AI coding assistant we gave it to Claude code the new agentic coder on the Block and we said here's a great comprehensive plan build this for us okay so um I hope you can see why that's so valuable if you kind of get it if you understand where things are going hit like hit subscribe join the journey as we dig into using these tools and getting massive value out of these tools for your engineering work for your career and for your projects as mentioned in principal ad coding soon there will be nowhere else to go AI coding tools are taking over Engineers using these tools as you can see here they're doing more than ever thought possible before an engineer even writing iterative prompts over and over and over they're not coding like this right they're not generating as much as they could be okay so this is really important so what are we doing now so now we're actually running our mCP server right so we just created a brand new pocket pick codebase as a mCP First Tool so now we're going to test it all right now we're fing up Claud you can see there no tools right no mCP tools and now we're going to take this Command right Claude mCP add Pocket pick and you know I'm adding some documentation here for uh snippet reuse and and we're going to fire that off so again looks like everything's working well that was successfully added I'm going to add some more documentation here again just for reuse I don't like to constantly be looking this stuff up so I always add these to my readme or you know some type of documentation so Claude mCP list is going to show uh the mCP servers I noticed that uh there's a bug here sometimes you have to run Claude mCP list twice to get the true list so that's what I've done you can see the second time pocket pick actually lists so there it is when I run claw you can see pocket pick exists as an mCP server if we go full screen we can get this nice beautiful view of claw code and now I'm saying you know list all the tools and so you know there's an issue here Cloud code running Sonic 3 7 it's not perfect so I'm going to be more precise here with my prompt I'm going to say um list pocket pick tools and you know just trying to be a little bit more precise with my prompt and there it is so we can see all the capabilities we have access to Via this new pocket pick mCP server that we had Cloud code uh you know quite literally one shot for us I think it was one shot in you know maybe uh two or three small follow-up prompts and so now we're running our first Command right so pocket list and we have an error okay so this is something that's going to happen we're we're we're expecting our large scale agentic coding tools to get us 90 95 99% of the way there so I'm literally just going to take that error and write a follow-up prompt inside of clog code detailing where the issue is right at this point in the video at this point Claude understands this codebase better than I do right I I haven't even seen half the files in this code base right speaking of tradeoffs when you use agentic coding tools like this you will naturally understand less of what is getting built right in more high stakes production products I am spending a lot more time on the review process so that change got implemented I'm now running um the same Command right list all pocket picks there it is and now we have the correct response no items found so our pocket pick database is empty as you saw there Claude giving us some key information and now what we need to do is add some content to our pocket pick database pocket pick helps us keep track of ideas patterns and code Snippets I'm sure you've run into this issue a million times where you have a code snippet you have some piece of code that you refer to over and over and over again for me I refer to you know these model documentation all the time right but there are you know many other things that uh you might want to refer to for instance you might want to save how to run the claw 3.7 thinking tokens right you might want to save specific you know a or startup commands you might want to save um you know some documentation or quote that you liked or an idea that you liked right there's tons of examples of things that you might want to save right so I'm doing something really cool here um this is an mCP First Tool so I'm saying use PB paste and add a new pocket pick item with these tags so this is really cool so you can see there's the paste and there's the Pocket ad command with the text with the tags the tool is alive we have built this thing right and in we've built it in fractions of the time that it would have taken if we did this by hand or even with iterative a coding prompts okay so I mean I mean you know you can you can literally go back and count if you want um you know we ran Maybe six prompts and one prompt did 90% of the work right uh thanks to our spec so just testing out functionality here you can see I just ran pocket git with that exact ID and got that you know correct item and now we're just continuing to look through I want to add additional pocket picks right I want to add additional items into my pocket pick database to work with so I'm going to the open AI model page just going to do a quick Copy and you know kind of run that same thing right so I'm saying PB paste uh ppck ad so I'm using it you know on the Fly uh information T keyword that I literally just made up out of nowhere ppck add and then uh some tags right and I actually just I should have prefixed that with tags but Cloud code is going to get it here it understands uh how to write this and there you go uh there's that new Pocket ad command you can see item successfully added with those tags so it did you know understand the proper tagging and now we're going to run clear to reset everything I don't want Cloud Cod having the context of what just happened I want that fresh session and there we go so I'm running um pocket list tags so now you can see all the tags that currently exist in the pocket pick SQL light database and so now we're going to run pocket pick find 03 mini and I'm going to look for it in substring mode I really should have chosen a different mode there because substring is the default but you can see there it found that pocket pick item and now we're going to run uh list tools again so we're want to see all the tools available so just letting claw work through whatever it needs to run to show me the available tools there it is so I'm going to run pocket backup so I want to back up the database and so you can see there I just ran LS through Claude this is a kind of cool way to run commands you can just type you know Point Blank uh bash commands shell commands and now I'm saying back up the database using absolute path so you know back up to this current directory and then I'm going to run LS again write in claw code and you can see there's the result we now have that backed up database so that works great and opening up a new terminal tab here I'm going to move to that directory I just want to just doing validation right I want to make sure that things are actually working as expected opening up a cursor instance here using a nice extension here that lets me view into SQ light databases and as you would expect we have our two rows so again we're just validating right a lot of what we're going to do now in the AG of generative AI with these powerful AI coding tools is just curate validate review double check triple check and tweak right so what we're going to do now is add an additional mCP tool as you can see Cloud code by itself is incredibly powerful Cloud code is even more powerful when you add a tool but when you start stacking these mCP servers together you get something truly extraordinary so that's what we're going to do here we're going to add fetch to make it easier to put together these pocket pick items so again I'm adding documentation right I highly recommend you you don't just copy this stuff and fire once like make it reusable right make it easy for yourself to keep winning make it easy for yourself to move fast so creating that command there and then I'm going to you know end this session move back to Cloud code kill this session you can see there that was a 13 C session not cheap for the little work that we did um but there we go right so added that server validated it with mCP list and now we can click off claw with a brand new mCP server connected right so now we have the ability to make web requests I'm going to the Gemini docs and you can guess what I'm going to do here right copy the URL fetch Gemini web page then I'm saying then add Pocket pick item then of course I'll specify tags so we're going to say llm models Gemini and Flash so whenever I want to look up this pocket pick item I can just search for llm models gemini or Flash right so there it is uh we need to give YOLO mode access to uh scrape this entire page over and over so that's what we're doing we're you know we're letting Cloud code operate in its highest efficiency mode right which is Yolo mode it's just agentic right um it did make a mistake here I want all the content it's doing some trimming um this is one of the Annoying Parts about some of these models they try to uh uh you know reduce context sometimes so you have to be explicit every once in a while and there we go so we saw that that new Gemini pocket pick item got added fantastic so now I can run lists again information T keyword there ppck tags and there we go so uh there are all of my tags now we're going to go ahead and and find all of my items I want to look for all my llm tags and then create a markdown file with all the models right so there we go so we're going to run that first command you can see that that was wrong that was the wrong command so immediately Cloud code pivoted to the pocket list command versus the pocket find pocket find is for looking up texts and pocket list is for searching via tags I probably could have improved the naming there but as you can see here we're working through it making progress there's that llm models file that all looks great and now I'm just going to do some more you know ad hoc testing you've seen me do this in a couple previous videos you know create the AML and Json version I'm just kind of playing with Cloud code here and uh you know validating some functionality so you know this tool these tools are incredibly powerful okay it's important to stay up to date it's important to understand what you can do with these tools on the channel I try to share you know as much as I can with the time that I do have I try to share with you these kind of key AI coding ideas and principles and patterns but you know in every video we only really scratch the surface of what we can do I highly highly recommend you check out principle a coding if you haven't already um this is my take on how to transition from the old ways of engineering to the new way where we code and build faster than ever with AI coding tools like AER cursor and now Claude code right and whatever is coming next in the course we focus on principles not tools we focus on principles not models we know that models will continue to evolve we know that tools will just keep changing but you know what matters and I'm really proud of this the fact that you know with every passing day with every release principled ad coding is still relevant in fact it's it's it's even more relevant than it was when it was launched okay so I highly recommend you check it out um um I'm I'm packing in bonuses after bonuses inside the tool I'm going to be releasing a state of AI coding a long form essay detailing tools I'm using the models I'm using I'm going to break down where the industry is at where the industry is going so again that's going to be available exclusively for principled ad coding members that have taken principal AI coding to completion so I highly recommend you check that out I put a lot of Blood Sweat and prompts into principal AI coding it's going to help you move fast it's going to help you remain and be relevant and truly Thrive with these air coding tools as you saw here in this video um it's all about adaptability it's all about patterns that you can reuse across code bases across time and the best best way to form these patterns is with concrete principles so definitely check that out Link's going to be in the description for you um this codebase pocket pick is also going to be available for you if I have time I will create a full um you know piie hosted version of this so we can just run uvx on this but this is cloud code this is um you know a a just a glimpse of a coding with these tools like I mentioned I only spent $2 here I spend hundreds across the week shipping more code than ever if you enjoyed this video if you want to stay up toate hit the like hit the Subscribe join the journey thank you so much for watching stay focused and keep building",
