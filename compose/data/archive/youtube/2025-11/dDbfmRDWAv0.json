  "raw_transcript": "what's up Engineers welcome back Andy Deb danan here 12 days of open AI went out with a bang they announced 03 and Next Generation Benchmark breaking reasoning model Google's Gemini 2.0 flash is very clearly absolutely cracked and it's still 100% free the sleeping giant has awoken I have no idea how Google is able to offer this at scale oh wait I do they're rich and they want to get developers like you and I on their side not going to lie it's working meanwhile we have anthropic to me they seem like the cool guy in the corner at the party having a good time like it knows something everyone else does not I'm confident we'll see something absolutely insane out of anthropic relatively soon last but not least of course we have Lama 4 right around the corner it's going to have multiple releases really really excited for this tons and tons of models released are fine tunes on top of the Llama series with these next generation models right around the corner the question for you and I as engineers and product Builders Remains the Same how can we use as much compute as possible with powerful models and the best AI coding assistance and AI tooling to build tons of software at higher rates than ever while maintaining high quality in this video I want to showcase a powerful promp chain built into my favorite AI coding assistant AER this promp chain is called architect mode architect mode is simple it's a prompt chain of length two where you have one model that drafts your code second model is the editor the editor takes the draft from the architect and generates real working code this workflow is the best way to understand what's coming next a topic we'll discuss more in this video with all the hype around Gemini 2.0 flash I thought it would be cool to pit it up against the reigning Undisputed Champion Claude 3.5 son it in this video we're going to boot up two AI coding assistants and see if Gemini 2.0 flash can code like the champion near the end of the video I have a massive announcement and a new opportunity for you I'm insanely excited to finally release if you ride code with AI stay tuned so you don't miss that what are we working on to show off this powerful prompt chaining technique using AER let's open up vs code let's break down what's happening here so on the left I have an AER setup command that is going to start our AI coding assistant in architect mode where we're running two models the architect is going to be Gemini 2.0 Flash and the editor is going to be Gemini 2.0 Flash the model is effectively talking to itself one time it's thinking the other time it's editing and then on the right we have that exact same thing with the reigning Champion the best llm for AI coding hands down the only exception to this now is the brand new 01 series that's slowly rolling out we're going to be covering that on the channel in the future yes always this is going to accept the architext changes anytime they're suggested and then we have a brand new loading feature out of Aer that lets you save and reload sets of context all I'm going to do here is copy this paste it inside a terminal and what you'll see here is AER will boot up in architect mode and it will add every one of these files in this .or file to the context we're going to do the exact same thing on the left side so we're going to boot up Gemini and you can see we have the exact same context if we type SL tokens Gemini 2.0 flash is completely free with a million tokens in available context window if we run tokens on the red side claw 3.5 Sonet of course has a price tag to it we're running at about 1 cent per prompt this is of course well within the bounds of what we're willing to pay to get a lot done in fraction of the time it used to take so here are two sets of models we're running two Geminis on the left and two Cloud 3.5 sonets on the right so this is great we have our AI coding assistant but what are we actually updating what is this code what are these files I have this project that I've been building up is a personal knowledge base for your AI agents this is going to become more relevant we're going to talk about this code base more on this channel in 2025 but you can see here you can do a couple very simple things you can add arbitrary content list all of your cont content you can find similar content via embeddings remove content and back up the database everything here runs on a private local SQL light database if we open up the terminal we can easily run one of these commands let's go ahead and run our list command we just have a couple of items so what are the changes we're going to make right we have this personal knowledge based system that we're building up what are we going to add to this so we need to add a couple new commands and we're going to do that by firing a large spec prompt so what is the spec prompt it is essentially a plan for the work you want done it's a specification document except this specification document is built for your AI coding assistance you can see here we have four sections the headline of the changes we want changed the objective context and low-l tasks so the objective is of course what we want changed at a high level you can see here I want to add these three new commands I want the ability to quickly add YouTube scripts so pull down YouTube videos get a transcript for the YouTube video and then save that into the knowledge base this will help me run arbitrary queries and prompts on my existing YouTube content we also have ADD site basically you scrape down a website and then you store that in your personal knowledge base and then we're adding a Syle command this is just something that's missing from the knowledge base if we open up main you can see all of our current commands if we collapse add remove list similar and backup this is going to give us the ability to grab a knowledge based item by ID what's context context is of course every file file you need to get the change done you can see how this spec document is starting to drill in to the changes and detail out more information for AI coding assistant if we go back to our vs code Windows you can see we've added all of those files into our AER instances on the left and on the right we're almost ready to run this prompt the last thing we need to look at is of course the lowlevel tasks what I have written here is a list of prompts so a whole set of information Rich prompts I'm not going to go into much detail here of how this works I'll add some links to how some of this stuff works in the description but effectively what we have in our low-l tasks is a list of prompts that our AI cing assistants can execute top to bottom to get the work done you can see there's more detail in here than you're probably used to I'm writing very accurate very precise AI coding prompts we'll talk more about these prompts in the future on the channel so let's close everything and let's execute this spending all this time explaining this let's go ahead and fire this off we'll open up VSCO I want to measure success in the most blunt forward way the only thing that really matters of course I'm being a bit reductive here but there are only three things that really matter as a software engineer first did you accomplish the task two how much time did it take you and lastly what did it cost we're going to judge our two AI coding assistants by the same metrics so let going go ah and pce this in both sides here so after this prompt runs we fully expect to be able to run these three commands on both code bases without flaw so here we go on the left we're going to run Gemini on the right we're going to run Sonic we want to know if they built the three features we asked for the three new commands how quickly they did it what it cost obviously Gemini wins automatically on the cost but let's go ahead fire these off and check out the results okay so right away you can see flash is Off to the Races so right now both aing assistant they're in architect mode so they're just drafting all the changes that need to happen here um you can see on the left here Gemini flash is quite a bit faster the architect just finished now the editor is going on the right Sonet just finished the architect just finished and now the editor model is firing off on the right side I think Sonet no no I think I think flash is coming up to the finishing line here um it's writing tests we have a prompt for writing tests in there um let's see where is Sonet right now Sonet is oh man Sonet is updating the read me okay so son it actually finished a little bit faster no so flash has finished now they both ran into linting errors I have yes always so they're going to both automatically fix the linting error let's see how they perform here so Sonet is Sonet is finished Sonet has finished first I'm actually quite surprised Here and Now flash is finished okay so that was exciting a lot of stuff happened there if we just analyze the results here this costs us a total of 12 cents for this session and there's no cost for flash so on speed surprisingly son it won I think it won because it received a much fewer tokens um I think on a token by token basis flash would have won but let's go ahead and actually see if our AI coding assistants accomplished the task right this is the most important thing if they haven't accomplished the task we asked them to complete then all the other side metrics like cost and speed don't matter at all so let's go ahead and see if we can run our new knowledgebase command so what I'll do is I'll open open up new terminals on both sides if I type get status you can see all the changes that are model made here and get status on the left side here same deal right just clear this let's go ahead and start with sonnet so if we open up main we should be able to see all of our new commands all collapse and you can see we do have three brand new typer methods let's go ahead and run our add YouTube script method so we also asked for usage docs so we have this exact command that we can just copy out and run what we expect here is a new knowledge based item with this YouTube script and if we just open this up you know this YouTube script is going to be I want to share my our AI engineering 2025 plan max out compute super relevant this is the video we want to pull the transcript from so I'm going to copy nearly all this command I'm going to start from the python since we already are running in a virtual environment I'll paste the send so let's see if our Sonic 3.5 prompt chain completed our ad YouTube script command for us automatically so this is good as thinking we do get this bad recognized option so we do get an issue here all I'm going to do here is copy I'm going to copy the entire output here typer gives us a nice output block here I'm going to come back to our air coding assistant I'm just going to paste this in so I'm giving Sonic one shot to correctly resolve the issue so I'm going to hit enter there and then we're going to move over to the left side so let's see if Gemini properly wrote that command so if we do the same thing we go to main while our Claude and is running on the right um let's go ahead and collapse and let's see our commands here we do have git at the top add YouTube script and then we have ADD site so this looks good let's open this up we do have some nice usage docs from the Gemini flash model let's go ahead and see if this command will execute for us so same deal and let's see if Gemini created this command properly for us okay so we ran into an issue right away definitely disappointed here I'm going to copy all this and do the same thing we're going to give both Gemini and Sonet a chance I'm just going to come to the instance I'm going to paste this in execute let's hop back over to our Claude AI coding assistant in architect mode and let's just rerun to see if it resolved the issues it had so I'm just going to hit enter here and let's see if it can get it right okay fantastic so you can see we have added YouTube transcript 12 let's go ahead and test the new git method right so we should have this new git command here let's let's open this up and let's go ahead and fire it off so you can see here we created this new YouTube transcript with id2 let's go ahead and just run git with id2 so if we hit enter here wonderful so we can see our new git command gave us back that exact instance if we open this up here you can see we have this transcript so this worked really really well so we have one more command to test here for our Claude AER prompt chain running in architect mode and that is going to be our site method so let's go ahead and see add site just copy this from python so you can see here python main.py add site and we're going to pull from the anthropic research building effective agents blog post if we click into this we can see exactly what this looks like there's a great rundown um a lot of the ideas discussed here we have discussed on the channel of course building blocks workflows agents we can search prompt chains you know this is a really popular idea we have and quite literally are discussing right now great posts it's weird cuz it kind of feels like you know on the channel we've discussed so many of these ideas long ago frankly but it's cool to see this collected by a you know big player in the a agent space so this is great so anyway so let's go ahead and use this URL and let's see if our Sonet instance was able to build up this command end to end right and you can see some of the details here right we download the site generate embeddings and then we run our ad KB row command which inserts it into our sqlite database and so let's go ahead and fire this off and let's see if we can add this new site to our personal knowledge base no issue so far that's a good sign so we're probably scraping right now generating embeddings and there it is so added website content at id13 if we just type our list command here U main list and we actually need to drop UV there since we're already in a virtual environment we can just fire this off and we should see both our website and our um new site content so that looks good let me actually just go ahead and use the git command that we were just using and this is going to be ID3 fantastic so check this out so we have the markdown formatted version of anthropics agent post right so this is fantastic it's it's working perfectly we have this inside of our knowledge base and we can use some quick similarity search if I just highlight workflow routing and we have this similarity Search Command here I was using it earlier we just clear this out paste this here it's going to be the top hit so we're looking for the similar items with this text and you can see there that is of course our top hit so we got that knowledge based row returned immediately so this is fantastic we had one issue here with the Claude 3.5 Sonet prompt chain running in AER in architect mode but overall the changes went through you know we can see we can do a get diff here and if we want to we can even run get diff and then write the diff to a file so def. text and then we can see exactly how much was changed here right so you know about 2,000 tokens worth of file change so this is fantastic um we should have a readme update as well yeah so we have this readme update which is really cool part of our spec prompt asked for changes to the read me so you can see here um we have new documentation around adding YouTube content adding website content and getting content by ID so you can see we have great usage documents here let's switch back over to our Gemini flash AI coding assistant and let's see if it was able to correct the mistake it had let's go ah a and just open this up a little bit more too the issue happened on the add YouTube script call so we'll just hit up and let's see if this issue was resolved so let's run this okay uh same deal let's give it even more grace we'll copy this and again we'll let Gemini flash attempt to fix its issue it runs really quickly but it seems to get things wrong from time to time um to be fair this is a three feature spec prompt where we're asking for three changes right we want three concrete things modified so there's room for confusion for a large language model but it's pretty clear even with this small AI coding sample here you know it's taking us an additional AI coding prompt uh to get Gemini flash where Sonic 3.5 is so let's go ahead and just rerun this again let's see if Gemini flash has resolved its issue this is good it's taking some time to load here added item 12 that's looking good so far let's go ahead and look for get there it is we have our new git command so it did successfully create this you can see we have that new git knowledge based row function call and if we open that up you can see here diving into the layers of this code base we also have that called there so that looks great let's go ahead and run this so we'll copy this command from the python and this is item 12 so let's see if we can get item 12 from our knowledge base fantastic you can see we have that entire YouTube transcript from that video we were able to add this to our knowledge base right so this looks great we have one more command to run here on the Gemini flash a coding assistant code base let's look at add site method here everything looks relatively good let's copy this paste let it run right now it's scraping the site so that's good it got to that point so if we run the git for item 13 so let's just quick search git update this to item 13 we should see that anthropic building effective agents blog post nice and we can go ahead run that again and save this to a file we can say um AI docs building F uh agents and throp and markdown right so we can run that again and now we have that loaded out of our knowledge base we should have this new AI dock here and you can see we have that post from open AI exactly if we search prompt chain you can see that exact same uh search here from the site right so really really cool to see these two models perform up against each other it's pretty clear that flash it's a great model it's free there's a lot of intelligence there it definitely is not on par with cl 3.5 Sonet but it is still a fantastic model so you'd be surprised how many times I've done this I run a large prompt in a code base and then I'll revert the code base duplicate it a couple times and see if another set of AI coding assistants with different models can get to that same place in the exact same amount of time speed cost so on and so forth so you know jury Zen um Claude ran the fastest it made fewer mistakes right it made two fewer mistakes than Gemini and it did cost so we're going to give Claude two points Gemini did not run the fastest it had two additional errors but it was free right and we did get there eventually to be fair so we're going to give Gemini one point this is just a simple comparison these models are both great we still need to see a little bit more juice coming out of Gemini in order for it to be on par with Sonet uh for the longest time Sonet has been on the top of the leaderboards it is the most effective model for the most use cases but that is definitely changing with the release of 01 through the API which we're going to be looking at in upcoming videos and of course 03 mini and 03 so it's going to be super super wild to see you know model combinations and models like this roll out in the future I wanted to share aer's architect mode AER and prompt chaining again here with you just because it's going to be a very important pattern as we get access to more powerful models and we start really building out our AI agents and agentic workf flows in 2025 I highly recommend you read through anthropics blog post here it's a lot of what we've talked about in the past but when a big company backs up everything we've been talking about on the channel and writes about it in detail you know that tells you a things uh on the channel we are on the right track we have been for a while and we're going to continue with that Trend but also there's a lot of really key ideas here one of them being prompt chaining that's going to be increasingly important as reasoning models allow us to plan and execute large amounts of work you know just to kind of call that out explicitly here again this spec prompt um detailed everything I wanted done in detail right that change pushed out uh tokens on both Gemini and Claud 3.5 sonit in a very very kind of precise way across multiple files I mean you saw that context window right which is you know not something I normally suggest unless it's required by the change you have we have over 10 files here and you know on both sides we edited over 2 or 3,000 tokens changed how were we able to do this we're able to do this by scaling our efforts with a larger prompt right this is a theme that's going to be really important as we move into 2025 the amount of work you can hand off to your AI tooling is going to increase as models improve so that means we need better patterns like the spec prompt to allow us to pass off more work to our AI coding tools and our AI Tooling in general this technique and other AI coding techniques and the speed and Pace in which AI tools and models are improving and increasing it's all part of the reason why I created something I'm really excited to share with you right now this has been a long time coming I want to introduce you to principled AI coding principal AI coding is my take on the best way to learn AI coding for 2025 and Beyond the whole point the whole theme with this course is to learn principles of AI coding that will help you you know not just stay relevant but Excel with the AI coding tools of today and tomorrow okay so this is my official AI coding course link is going to be in the description for you uh the theme here is really simple you can read through this but I'll just scroll down to kind of the key takeaway um here right AI coding is the new standard so 2024 I think is the last year where if you are not using AI coding tools it's fine it's it's going to be okay I can no longer say that with confidence this is going to be the fastest way to fall behind and deprecate your career this is a course built for Engineers this is engineering focused and the entire goal of this is to really address the fact that we are hitting that threshold point where if you're not engineering with AI you are not engineering just plain and simple full stop so I created this course to help you and other Engineers not just survive this transition but to thrive in a principled based way this is not a course about a specific tool or a specific model but this is really about the underlying principles of AI coding of software engineering with language models and AI coding assistant that's the focus for this entire course and it centers around mastering the big three the context prompt and the model if you've written code with AI you likely already know this is what matters your context model and your prompt this is a theme for generative AI you want to collect context select the mod model and create prompts and then hand off all the hard work to your AI coding assistant there's a lot of value here it's available to you um just to quickly go over what's in the course we have eight lessons in here so we're going to start from beginner move to intermediate and then end with Advanced I can only do this in course form because I have enough time I have the flexibility and the control to really create a guided experience for you so this is all here um I think the price is great you know we all want a good deal from someone we trust get in here early the price will go up I am putting this at the end of the video here for you know the true viewers of the channel the you know the die hards you know I want to give you guys a big thanks so we just crossed 30k Subs last week I think and YouTube let me know that we hit uh 1 million views in total just the other day which is absolutely insane so again I just want to say thank you I want you to have this course at the best cheapest price before it goes up there are some pretty bleeding edge ideas here they were likely going to become mainstream as people start taking the course and sharing some of the key ideas here so anyway I don't want to preach on this too much a lot of YouTubers a lot of content creators they go the sponsorship route but you know that doesn't feel real to me and I don't want to give you something that I wouldn't want Myself by creating this course by owning you know the IP by owning the ideas behind this and being able to share it with you I've created content 100% relevant to the channel and to engineers and to you know you and I this is the course that I wish I had when I started AI coding two years ago now once you sign up the dashboard looks like this super clean super simple you'll be able to see all of your courses your course progress you'll be able to uh you know leave a review report any issues you see ask questions so on and so forth you'll start out with the first three lessons unlocked and then once you cross the 50% threshold you'll unlock the next lesson and the next and the next and the next all the way till the end um this is principal AI coding this is my take on teaching AI coding in a indepth principled way where we don't just focus on the tool we focus on the principles underneath the tool principles not tools I think if we look at the ecosystem at a high level what we're seeing is new series of models new reasoning capabilities we see 03 completely smashing and just saturating benchmarks just d destroying benchmarks into ashes for us you know I want to Full Circle back to the beginning here and talk about the question that I think about every single day now how can I use as much compute as possible with powerful models and the best AI tooling AI coding assistants to build more software at higher qualities faster than ever right that's that's where my head's at right you want to be solving more problems higher scale higher rate with these powerful models right we have the old1 series we have the new Gemini 2 Series we're going to have llama 4 soon that's going to shatter the open source ecosystem once again and kind of reset it and then of course we have whatever anthropic is cooking up so our potential is limited by what we can do with these incredible tools language models are superpowers now the question is how can we access them how can we tap into them and for AI coding specifically that is a big part of why I built principled AI coding toward the end toward the advanced lessons the question is really about unlocking as much compute as possible learning to build context the right way so that we can pass off as much work as possible to our AI coding assistant this is a huge theme as we say AI agents roll out more and more this theme will continue long video today I hope you enjoyed it I hope you understand where things are going and I hope this technique you know prompt chaining AER Arch Tech I hope it all makes sense to you in upcoming videos we're going to be talking about the 2025 predictions and we're also going to be looking at the new o1 series that is getting rolled out right now we have some interesting things happening on that same theme um the creator of Aer has rolled out a brand new Benchmark a polyglot leaderboard that is a much harder AI coding Benchmark 01 is already at the top of this and you can see the incredible gap between claw through 5 son it the you know current kind of or the previous I guess state-ofthe-art model and the new 01 coming out of the API this is really incredible we're going to be covering this as soon as we get API access I'm hoping that rolls out over the next week really incredible stuff here really excited to see some new harder benchmarks um I'm going to link this blog post in the description as well Paul aers Creator is one of the best Engineers to be following right now his writing and his benchmarks are something that I reference often in order to understand how the AI coding ecosystem is evolving we had to pick a tool in the principal AI coding course for me it was an absolute no-brainer to choose AER because it is foundational AI coding software thanks for watching next week we're going to be looking at our predictions for 2025 it's going to be a big year like
