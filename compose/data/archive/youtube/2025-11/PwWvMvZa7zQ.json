  "raw_transcript": "in this video I want to break down how you can use Advanced prompting techniques to generate entire front-end components it doesn't matter if you're in vue.js react felt or solid you can use these prompting techniques across every language across any domain of front-end Engineering in this video I'm going to be using vue.js I'm using a basic Vite TS template we're going to create a carousel component it's something that's a little more complex that you would likely look for a pre-built component to do for you but with this prompt template I'm getting ready to show you you can generate this component in a matter of minutes while maintaining full control over the implementation so you don't have to dig through and understand the documentation of a pre-built component I'm going to be using chat GPT first things first I'm going to generate a complete prompt that is going to help us build this component and many others I'll speed through this so you don't have to sit through this all right so I've completed writing this prompt let me go ahead and drop this into GPT while this is running let's go ahead and break down exactly how this prompt works so please ignore all spelling mistakes I'm sure I made a couple in here gbt will automatically correct those and assume what I meant let's dive into the individual prompting techniques I use in this prompt this is a technique called role prompting you tell the llm the exact role you wanted to play here I'm telling it your senior vue.js front-end engineer that mentored directly with evanu the creator of vue.js after you define the role next you want to define a purpose I'm telling the llm you have a new project that requires you to build a new component so now we're setting the stage we have both a roll and a purpose next we're going to define the requirements I'm using a list based format to Define exactly what we want the llm to accomplish when building the component as its role basically you want to be as verbose as you can defining the functionality bullet point by bullet point to recap what we've done so far we're using the roll technique purpose technique and now we're creating requirements as a list the last two chunks I like to refer to as memory building we're going to give GPT two pieces of information it can use to help it complete its job I'm giving it a function to navigate between the slides in the Carousel and then I'm saying I'm letting GPT know I want it to use modern view 3 script setup syntax and then I'm giving it an example of exactly what that looks like specifically to accommodate for its cut off date of September 2021 so as you quickly recap we gave it a roll we gave it a purpose we gave it a list of requirements and then we gave it two pieces of information to help build its memory you can reuse the structure you can template out both the memory portions you can modify vue.js to be any front-end language you want and build any type of component that you need by replacing the requirements so let's see how this prompt actually performed we can see GPT finished and all I'm going to do here is copy the code and place it right in a brand new component without modifying it we're going to run it and see how it's done I'm going to replace the hello world component all right so we have a couple mistakes we're going to go ahead and correct these try to export this function remove that and refresh and as you can see we have slide one and we have a previous index button just as described in the prompt as I try to click here I can see that nothing's happening that's okay we don't expect it to work 100 but we do expect it to get us 90 of the way so let's just look around the component and see if we can figure out what's going on click events looking good titles we have the class we do see that it's double nested in a component which it does not need to be and I already see the issue here we're missing some Styles so what I'm going to do is merge these parent components together get rid of the width get rid of this outer container apply a flex shrink to the slides we can see that this is mostly working looks like we're getting a little off kilter here with our position sliding get rid of some of the CSS awesome when we take a deeper look at the previous next block buttons here we can see that we're going to the wrong pages all right so we've added disabled here on the previous and next buttons where they don't make sense I'm going to go ahead and just get rid of the click events completely now we have a brand new Carousel component there are many ways to tweak this and to improve this right like you can move these divs into separate components you can take your position and set it to a concrete variable so you can iterate through a large number of pages not just three what we've seen here is that you can get a really concise piece of code generated from a single prompt again we're not at the place where we're getting 100 accuracy on components that are a little more complex but we are at a place where if you define and use a good prompt with several Advanced prompting techniques you're going to get yourself of 80 to 90 percent of the way there I now have a mostly complete Carousel component that I can use to start putting together a web application experience that is unique and that I have full control over and can change thanks to the help of prompt engineering techniques the world of software engineering is changing the future of software engineering is likely going to be llm base I think as you start prompt engineering and using it to write your front-end code and code in general you compose a series of props which then represents an AI agent and then you have ai agents that write code for you that design that help you run your business and it all starts with understanding how you can write great prompts just to recap this one more time we use four prompting techniques here the roll technique purpose technique list requirements and then we build two pieces of memory we then came in inspected the results and made a couple adjustments to the UI and just like that we now have a full page Carousel component AI driven development is the future of software engineering if you want to see more content like this so you can stay on the bleeding edge of what's possible subscribe like and I'll see you guys in the next video",
