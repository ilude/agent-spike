  "raw_transcript": "This is one of those things that I keep emphasizing with AI. Just try it. You will learn if you are willing to try. If you're with teams and you're trying to sort of not teams the software, teams the people like people teams, let your team try it. Celebrate the wins your team is getting with co-pilot. Encourage your team by showing them that you value their time saved. And you will not just pile more work on. You will not just tell them you must not be that good at your job because you did it that fast. you'll actually celebrate the win. Okay, here's the reality. I'm going to go right back to the beginning. The CTO wrote me and was like, they're only using email, 6,000 person company. These companies are are using 10% of a six-figure investment in some cases, whereas the ones that are using it fully, they're getting or more return on investment. The swing that I see here is insane.",

Copilot Name Chaos: Microsoft slapped the Copilot brand on twelve different SKUs, so enterprises routinely buy the wrong license and stall adoption.\n 2. Underused Potential: Most teams limit Copilot to email drafts, ignoring high-value workflows like instant pivot tables, meeting-minute generation, and screenshot-based troubleshooting.\n 3. Workflow Mindset: Treat Copilot as \u201cintelligence on tap\u201d across entire processes\u2014prompt chains, cross-app report builds, and Vision-enabled data extraction reclaim hours.\n 4. Cultural Rollout: Small pilots, role champions, shared prompt libraries, and relentless measurement turn isolated wins into organization-wide productivity shifts.\n 5. ROI Stakes: Done right, Copilot saves roughly three hours per worker each week and can return twenty-fold on license spend.\n 6. Future Baseline: Within a year, advanced Copilot fluency will be table stakes; laggards will sacrifice competitive edge.\n\nQuotes\n\u201cCompanies are literally paying for a Ferrari and they are driving it to the grocery store in first gear.\u201d\n\u201cIf AI was as good as it needs to be to take our jobs, I wouldn\u2019t have to make this video.\u201d\n\u201cCopilot mastery is going to look like a basic requirement in about a year.\u201d\n\nSummary\nI spent months interviewing frontline users and dissecting case studies to learn why firms paying six-figure Copilot bills still use it only for drafting email. Microsoft stamped the Copilot name on twelve distinct SKUs, confusing leaders and burying huge gains. I decode each edition, reveal workflows from auto-generated pivot tables to cross-app prompt chains, and spotlight Vodafone\u2019s staged 68,000-seat rollout that recaptured three hours per worker weekly. The takeaway is cultural: pair phased experimentation, role-specific champions, ongoing measurement, transparent wins, and fearless prompt sharing to shift Copilot from novelty to indispensable enterprise leverage\u2014and secure twenty-fold returns on license spend.\n\nKeywords\nMicrosoft Copilot, Copilot SKUs, enterprise AI, workflow automation, prompt libraries, cultural change, Vodafone rollout, email productivity, Excel analysis, pivot tables, ROI",
