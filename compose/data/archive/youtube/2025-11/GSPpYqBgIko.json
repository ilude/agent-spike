  "raw_transcript": "[Music] all right welcome back if you haven't seen the previous two videos where we learn how to write and authenticate with notion definitely check those out in this video we're going to learn how to read from the notion apis we're going to be creating this structure all right so we're going to have a list of objects that specify the text the type and the ID of your notion blocks so let's go ahead and Jump Right In let's start our five minute timer I'm going to drop in a new function that's basically going to write a dict to a file so we're going to be able to easily see what's going on with our content by writing it to a Json file so just adding that function there and now let's go ahead and stub out a couple methods all right so let's create read text and GitHub copilot is going to help me out here so we're going to read text we're going to take a client and a page ID and this is going to fetch the content from the notion API so let's return response results all right so that's client blocks children list pass in your block ID which in this case will be the page ID and we're going to parse the response create simple blocks from content all right we'll pass in our client um and we'll pass in our content all right and so what we're going to do here is say simple blocks we'll call this page simple blocks and we're going to create a new object for now we'll just return that at the top for block and content we're going to create a simple block object we'll film the items in a second here and what we're going to do is say let's get our block ID perfect let's get our block type let's get our block let's see we'll say it has children perfect we'll just call this Rich text not exactly what we want here let's change this out a little bit call this block type let's go ahead and say if not rich text so if we don't have any text we're just going to go ahead and return and I'm going to update this this is actually going to be a rich text and let's quick take a break here and hop into the documentation so I can show you guys exactly where I'm getting all this from so if you go to the notion developer API hit API reference and hit retrieve block children you can see here it takes a block ID just like our function did and in the examples you can see here that it returns results with the individual notion formatted items so you know right now I'm parsing through the type and the rich text so that we can get our content so let's go ahead and hop back into our method and keep building so perfect so after we know if we have Rich text or not we can start creating our block content now let's go ahead and recurse if we have nested items like this notion won't pick this nested item up so we need to check if we if has children and if we do have children what we're going to do is get the nested children and we're going to set that equal to read text just like we did to get this initial page and then we're going to get our simple block children and set that equal to a recurse call on this function if it doesn't make sense don't worry about it too much basically we're just populating the children of this block because it has children all right after that we're going to run our append call on our blocks and add our simple block to that and proceed from there so let's go ahead and update our main function is going to get our content equals read text then let's go ahead and write to a file and then let's go ahead and get our simple blocks and let's write that to a file perfect absolutely love GitHub copilot here and let's just go ahead and run this and see if we made any mistakes bam let's check our content we'll format this file and you can see it's in the format just like over here in the notion initial response so that's perfect and now the moment of truth let's see if we can look at our simple blocks awesome fantastic so as you can see guys this is our final notion response we've parsed out the ID of the block the type and the text and if you look over here at our notion page you can see we have the items perfectly aligned with our actual notion page content so we have the tutorials we have the auth we have the root item and that's going to be it guys uh if any of this was like kind of complicated you know stop the video at any point I'm going to have all the links in the description it's going to be there to help you out really appreciate you guys watching these videos if any of this was confusing you got stuck anywhere drop a comment down below if this helped you get up and running super fast definitely definitely like And subscribe it helps the chat out a lot we just hit 100 Subs so I'm super excited to get to the next Milestones two three five one thousand so I hope this helped you guys out and I'll see you guys in the next one",
