  "raw_transcript": "those who plan the future tend to create it but how do you know your plan is worthwhile at all if you want to create the future you need a plan to get there here's a simple framework we're working through right now in this video series there are five PS you want to work through each one of them before you create the future with your plan you need to first set up principles we talked about our principles in the first video now that you have your plan for creating the future you need to hit that third P what's the third P of course it's the proof of concept the POC this is how in the engineering world we prove that our plan and our principles our mission is worthwhile you don't just go around throwing a bunch of money your time your life into a plan that might not even be worthwhile right this is how you take your idea to concept the POC is the critical middle step here principles plan proof of concept and why do we create the proof of concept we create the proof of concept to show proof of value this fourth notch on the P5 pyramid this moves us closer to the Future where we hit P5 we're going to talk about P5 in the final video of this three-part series but first let's talk about what we're doing in this video so in video one of this series we talked about key ideas key principles for engineering multi-agent applications like everything is a function this is a really important concept that we're going to dive into more today by looking at the proof of concept so let's look through our principles one more time before we jump to the proof of concept so we talked about using the right tool for the job right you don't want to be using something that's not going to be creating the value that you want to see in the first place right so it's super important to always use the right tool in this case agent for the job we talked about the idea that everything is a function we're going to look at this more in detail in just a moment and then we talked about asking great questions that yield great results for us your results are only as ever going to be as good as your questions are so think about what your AG agents need to do think about how you need to structure them and just ask questions around what needs to come next and then near the middle slend of this video we're going to look at one more bonus principle that Stacks up and will drastically multiply your output over time it's really the brother of everything is a function they're tightly correlated and they're you know really in sync so let's talk about the application we're building here right on this channel I like to take real examples I like to take real problems to show you how you can build your multi-agent applications we all have different types of problems trying to solve and this was a problem that I knew I could share with you because sharing it would provide a valuable insight into how to build multi-agent applications I'm obsessed with this stuff all I do is think about this stuff and I want to share my journey with you guys so that you can benefit from it so let's talk about the multi-agent application right so we're focused on a multi-agent YouTube automation metadata generator we're taking this huge manual process let's take a look at this right we're taking this large manual process of SEO research brainstorming titles creating thumbnails iterating improving the description selecting your hashtags and we're automating this entire process with our multi-agent YouTube automation tool so in the end we're going to end up with a tool that does all this stuff in the middle for us all we have is our rendered video and then it gets uploaded to YouTube all this stuff in the middle is going to get automated away always uplevel the problem you're trying to solve right so it's as simple as this we have a rendered video we need to generate metadata so we can quickly upload to Youtube that's it right so let's look at how exactly we're replacing this middle step with our multi-agent YouTube automation tool so let's go ahead and push this back and let's look at this in a little more detail this is my favorite charting Library this is something called mermaid you've seen me use it on the channel before it's so useful for just quickly diagramming things and looking through functionality let's go ahead and full screen this so we can take a deeper look at this awesome okay so you can see here we have this brand new flow right and it all starts from the same locations right we have the rendered YouTube video and then at the end we have the review and then we're going to upload to YouTube so we have all of this process right here in the middle that we're going to be working with in our proof of concept and you know what let's just fire this off I want to show you what we've been building so I'm going to go ahead and plop that right there so let me go ahead and just open up vs code fantastic so here we are let's go ahead and pull this forward and let me just walk through a couple things first so we're going to be looking at a new suite of tools that we're going to be building on this channel called the Indie Dev tools it's an agentic engineering toolbox for developers but right now we're focusing on on this use case of generating YouTube metadata so I'm going to take this long command we'll break this down in just a second don't worry about it and all I'm going to do here is Kick this off I'm going to open up the terminal activate poetry we're operating in Python and poetry and then I'm just going to paste this command in and let's look at the directory in which we're going to operate here so you can see we have this mock YouTube content and we have this audio file let's go ahead copy our script here and fire this off so let's go ahead and let that run and you can see here as as this runs you can see it's running the create transcription step as this runs this directory is going to slowly fill up with metadata that we can use to upload our YouTube video right right now it's doing all the hard work force we're going to push this back and just look at the architecture of what is actually going on here there you can see the transcriptions kicking off now that's awesome so let's go ahead and look at exactly what's happening here under the hood right so here's a new architecture diagram for our proof of concept so this is what's running right now in the background over there you know we have have this rendered YouTube video right just like before we're starting right here right so let's zoom in on this whatever your rendered asset is whatever the thing you're building your metadata around you're going to have that as the first input to your tool right so remember everything is a function you want to treat every step in your pipeline of code in your pipeline of product doesn't matter if you're using no code or low code tools it's best to think of everything as a function right everything is a function let's focus on that principle this principle is going to pay you dividends so let's go ahead and just look look at the application Through The Eyes of everything's a function we create YouTube metadata and then we Branch off in the two steps right so let's go ahead and just follow one of these steps let's let's generate the thumbnail right this is really important in the YouTube process we're going to be generating the thumbnail here we're going to have an llm agent do this and you know in the long term it's not going to matter what agent you're using you can be using open AI Dolly 3 you can be using some mid Journey API you can be using whatever you need to but the idea is all about the highle flow right don't get too lost in the dets of how it works right so we're going to be generating thumbnails LM agent is going to do that we then have a additional step here where we need to resize our thumbnails into the perfect thumbnail ratio and then finally we have a thumbnail ready once that's finalized that goes into the review step where we collect the other bits of our assets right the title the description and then we can finally upload to Youtube let's follow this upper Branch here generate YouTube metadata and that's treated as the input for our transcription step right we have the video that's getting passed to this step and then when we want to transcribe of course you need to transcribe on something right so we have the input of the video file coming in and that's going to create a transcript right so now we have a fully rendered transcript after this step and this is just a code step right we don't need an LM to do this LM is not the right job for this so we're going to focus on writing code to do this for us so in the POC we have code to do this for us right we're using fast whisper to generate our transcript so after the transcript we can now do other things a great way to architect your llm apps is to think what do I need to run this llm right what makes this prompt special what makes this agent Special and for the title in the description we're largely blocked on the script being ready so we have the script here that's going to flow into the description and the llm agent's going to look at the script and then generate descriptions same idea here with the titles we need the script we can also add other inputs to this right this is just kind of a simplified version you know there are other inputs like you know SEO keyword for the title we have like a rough draft title right and that can all be used to help get you to your your final step where you have all of your assets ready and now you're ready for that final manual review right that human input where you're kind of the curator of the information and the content that's being generated by your multi-agent system right so after you lock that in you can finally upload to YouTube right and the amazing part about this is we've now just engineered A multi-agent system that does all of this hard work for us right so all this is automated away so we have this running right now in the background let's see if that's completed awesome so let's look at the actual codee implementation here our metadata generation has finished running from our proof of concept let's look at how we took these core ideas of everything is a function and one more core principle we're going to talk about and let's look at how we took those ideas and really turned it into something solid something foundational blows this and let's just take a look at the output right so we started with just an audio file right and now you can see here let's go ahead and just pull this in here so now you can see here we have a couple different assets generated right we have the audio file we have the description we have the script in a Json form we have the script in a text form and of course we have our thumbnails right so this iteration created three thumbnails for us that's awesome and then we have a new set of titles generated for us as well right so aside from that initial metadata generation command there was no work on our end and that's what you want to be focused on with your llm agents right what are the inputs to your system and what are the outputs right start at that high level and then just like we did over here you know pull in and break down the smaller individual steps inputs outputs inputs outputs inputs outputs right it's the same thing everything is a function don't forget that right keep that in the top of Mind as we're walking through this everything is a function so let's dive into some of the code right it all starts at the main file of course we're using poetry we've got a couple other key libraries in here like typer so typer allows us to build a clean CLI like application flow so we can do things like this I can say poetry run IDT IND Dev tools and then we can say YouTube and now we have have a list of commands right so we can do help and as you can see here we have a whole list of individual commands in their own kind of sub command namespace where we can build smaller individual tools right and so you can see here we have these individual steps we've broken things into kind of function like elements right where we have the configuration command we have the description command we have generate metadata we have the script Command right so the script is going to transcribe the video thumbnail is going to be generating thumbnails for us and of course the title generates some titles for us right so that's how we're dividing the application up if we hop into the YouTube command you can see here we have this really simple structure we have commands modules and we have our main and we have our models right so let's go ahead and hop into commands and you can see here we have a slew of commands we're going to start at the top here with the YouTube command and so just like you saw in the output here right we have these list of commands those all correspond with these items here right so you know we have the thumbnail we have the title we have the script we have the description generation and of course we have that top function that we just ran earlier generate meta which combines all of our functions and runs them top to bottom in a single unified flow and you know I want to call out something here this really starts digging in to the second principle everything's a function but also the fourth principle build reusable building blocks if you want to build great software if you want to build reusable software that grows with you you don't want to be rewriting the same code the same applications the same workflows every every single time imagine if you started a new application and you built the same UI components every single time over and over right that's not a good use of your time we're Engineers we're better than that we know that we can take what we've done and reuse it in different ways and the main way we do that is build small composable pieces of software right so let's look at an example right let's look at the create title step so let's go ahead and open up the create title so I have that open here so create titles let's collapse this and just look at the top level right all this is in our modules directory create title that's all this does it helps us generate additional titles right we talked about breaking our code into smaller pieces before this is how we do that we have small individual modules that do one thing and they do it well right it's a small building block you can call create title anytime you want like let's go ahead and do it right now cuz I have that divided up for that reason right so so in the typer commands directory we can just run create titles right we don't need to run the entire flow we can just come in here right come into this single create title step right let's pull this in so the beauty about following this fourth principle and the second principle everything's a function and build reusable building blocks is this right if you have reusable building blocks your code is modular right so you can come in here and only run this step if you want to right and this is great for so many reasons a lot of senior Engineers know exactly why one of the big reasons this is so valuable is that you can test just this flow right here and nothing else so when you're able to to modularize your code like this create reusable small building blocks little functions that add up to bigger functions when combined your code is a lot more resilient it's a lot more maintainable and it is all those things because it's easier to just say just work on the description right just give me a description right and then just give me a title and then you know just generate thumbnails or just take this image and resize it right so we've engineer the entire metadata YouTube generator to match and utilize those principles right so so I can actually just come in here and just run this individual Command right so I have titles generated right here what I'm going to do is just underscore this then we're going to create a new batch and we'll look at the actual content of what got generated here in just a moment but let's go ahead and just run this so I just want to create you know a new set of titles so let's go to the titles command here and let's look at what that input is for the create command so it looks just like this so we're going to run poetry run IDT we're running the YouTube Suite of applications and then we're going to go into titles and then we're going to run create so let's go ahead and pass in this you can see that right there this- R flag and that's going to be our rough draft title and we can run with just that so you know let's say something like um you know coding with the Apple Vision Pro right so let's just say that so let's get some titles generated based on this rough draft we can also pass in the script file we can pass in count let's let's go ahead and generate uh we'll pass in the C flag as well let's generate four titles right and we'll skip the SEO keywords and let's just let that rip right so you can see right away we have our prompt and you know I'm going to share this code probably next week with the productionize version with you so you can dig into more of the details there's a lot going on here I just want to show off some of the top level key principles to proof of concept ideas that we're talking about here so that's finished and so we can just play this to make sure that our script is matching up nicely I can just go ahead and hit play so you can see here it's matched up pretty nicely technology is breaking the L limits on what you can build you can now create software that not only makes decisions for you nice right so that's working pretty well we can get that out the way let's look at the script Json so there's a script. txt and a script Json sometimes you want the individual segments of your script right so you know here's the entire script there and then we have segments right so this is just going to be the chunks right so LM technology is breaking not only can I make decisions for you so you know sometimes that's useful to have you want to just pass in some key information to your llm some different time stamps and different periods and then we have some descriptions so I formatted this in a hook first paragraph second paragraph and then an explanation of why the LM chose the first and second paragraph you know where it got the ideas from so this is cool this is ready it is you know automating a lot of the work for us you know in that final review step you're always going to want to take all the information you have and do a final review before you do anything with it right and this actually helps you iterate on the entire process right because you can say okay this part was good you know the title was good description was mid and you know maybe the uh thumbnails aren't as great as I want them to be that can all happen in your review process and then you kind of come back to the drawing board and you focus on what needs to be improved right that is what our multi-agent YouTube metadata generator looks like right now you know using these key principles that we talked about before right these principles are super helpful right using the right tool for the job do you need an agent here in our transcription stepped right there's just no reason to use an agent so if we pull that open here if we look in our modules here we have that create transcription step and this is using faster whisper to you know run the transcriptions we can you know create a limit sometimes you don't need to run through the entire transcript so that's all here for us to use you can see it's in a nice simple function it has an input has an output it creates a transcription file that is then used for the other steps in the process right so that's that so you want to be using the right tool for the job so sometimes it's code sometimes it's agents sometimes it's manual input right like for instance of course you need to render a full video before you can pass it in to your process right and then we have that key idea everything is a function by treating all of our flow as inputs and outputs to one another we can do things like this right we can have one super top level flow let me just go ahead and collapse this a little bit where we have you know our create transcription step we have our create title we have our description and we have our thumbnails right and at the top level we just arbitrarily want all these things to run top to bottom right right we can take these individual functions with inputs and outputs and tap into the fourth principle right build reusable building blocks we can now run this create title step on its own and really we can reuse that create title for any other application we want to build in this tool Suite right and really any other application so you want to be building reusable building blocks as you're building out your multi-agent applications because that tool that you're giving giv your agent that you know prompt you're probably going to want something like that again in a different version or you might want the exact same things so that's how we can you know use everything as a function think about everything as a function and of course you just want to throughout your process of your proof of concept keep asking great questions great questions are going to get you to your result even if you don't have a good idea just throw something at it right throw something at whatever you're building and just use that as a starting point right and then lastly just like we talked about use reusable building blocks everything is a function so make sure that your functions are isolated they're reusable and it allows you to you know take individual chunks like this isolate them test them modularize them this gives you a you know huge Advantage as an engineer having solutions to problems that you're I can guarantee you you're going to see multiple times over in different variants that's super important so you know this is the proof of concept we can now run a single script and like I said I'm going to share the code probably next week with you guys I want you to have that full view of how you can engineer multi-agent applications in a clean way but you know just looking at the readme here there's going to be a lot of cool functionality let's look at the cleaner version let's go Ahad in yeah there we go so you know there's going to be a lot of cool capabilities here all the way from generating metadata from top to bottom using you know the collection of methods and functions to the individual steps we can come in here and just you know all I want right now is a description and you know all I want is a thumbnail and you know it's it's a great way to just build software in general but specifically it's a great way to you know manage and control your multi-agent applications so you can take your principles turn them into plans create your proof of concept and then prove through your proof of concept that you know it is worth building at all right so you can hit that proof of value which gets you one step closer to creating the future you want to create right I've had so much fun you know building this video using this new technology let me know if you guys like this video format it's definitely different it's definitely new and uh you know I had a lot of fun doing it but let me know if you like this video format I know that some of the specs a little rough but but I think that what it offers is you know definitely worth it in exchange so what's next for a YouTube automation tool we're going to be hitting P5 what is P5 It's the final version of the application the first kind of you know push into the future of what you want to see what you want to build we're going to be productionizing the application and I'll be sharing this codebase with you if you're interested in this if you enjoyed this video format definitely drop the like drop the sub leave a comment let me know what you liked let me know what I can improve with this video format you know there's a decent amount going on here but I love being able to you know feel the work and walk through it with you in a in a you know much more tangible way right we can really dig in and and talk design we can talk software we can talk principles so I also want to mention the AI coding assistant tutorials are in the works right now I'm really excited to share that with you guys it's going to be a set of tutorials into some more premium paid courses for those that want all the gains that you can get from AI coding assistants there's a lot of interesting details to work out it's going to be one of the first AI coding assistant tutorials and AI coding assistant courses as you know on this channel we're kind of near the edge of a lot of what's being built what's happening right now so there are a lot of unknowns to confront there but I just wanted to call that out if you're interested in that you know hit the like hit the sub and yeah I just want to say you know thanks so much in the video we're going to have a full productionize version I'm going to share the code with you guys and we're going to bring our YouTube metadata automation multi-agent tool all the way there are a lot of things that I want to add to the final version right now there's no iteration step when you're creating thumbnails you want to be able to iterate on them and it's cool that we can generate you know five of them right now right like we can just pass in the count variable here but it would be cool if we could iterate on these and improve them over you know multiple iterations so some toing for that I also want this process to be a lot smoother right so I'm asking myself the question how can I make this the most seamless experience possible right right now everything's kicked off by this top level generate metadata step which is you know really cool this is a proof of concept so you you want and need to be doing some more hacky non ux UI focused things but you know I want to take the step I kind of want to build some like fully you know automated CLI that just walks me through the information that you know the multi-agent system needs to build the best metadata right and so maybe it just prompts me you know what's the rough draft title what are some keywords right it just prompts all this I would rather have that than you know walk through this kind of laborious step of setting up this command every single time you want to think of yourself as a user of your own applications you want it to be seamless you want clean experiences you want simple experiences so that you can focus more on producing value right and that's one of the big Ideas I want you to take away from this video we use llms and we use code we build software to solve problems and to do things that of course we can do it we can do it ourselves but we should be building tools to solve these problems for us right we want to be getting rid of all this manual crap here and building out software building out tooling to do it for us right building out multi-agent systems that can handle this all for us thank you so much for watching I really appreciate your time and that's going to be it for this one guys stay focused keep building and I'll see you in the next one with a fin analyzed version",
