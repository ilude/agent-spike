  "raw_transcript": "all right we have a ton to get to today we have agent stuff we have tools for Builders and uh we have some really interesting research coming out of Microsoft so number one it has been hard for people to get a sense of what you can do with an agent a new site called Agent recipes.com aims to change that by making it really clear visually what task the agent is accomplishing and also presenting code stets now agents are overhyped right now people are calling cron jobs agents people are doing anything they can to rename stuff agents because it gets funded so fast but that being said agents really are a class of AI tooling and it is helpful to understand what they can do and so I do appreciate it when people are building little sites this one's free where they you can just understand like what's in the box what's an agent now this brings me to the other side if you're not a developer if you're not getting the coding side you may want to use an agent or see an agent in a real use case and you may want to see what the business value is before you start to go after and build something let's say you're a builder but you're on the business side will pay for this is apparently going to be an agent driven Market listing tool for X where the agent will go out it will read X tweets all the time and it will select the ones that it feels represent Market signal and categorize them so that you can go through and see a curated feed out of x X and just see what people say they will pay for and choose to build that I think that's a really interesting use case because one if it works it's not launched yet if it works it shows a proactive agent use case which I think is one of the more genuine agent use cases in the wild I've seen there's a couple others but but it's a good one uh and then two it sort of Builds on itself because you're going to see a lot of use cases that agents in turn can help build and so it sort of stimulates the creation of the whole asan ecosystem all right number three this one is a little bit more Star Trek Microsoft has released matter gen which is it's close to when you can just order te on the Enterprise and it just appears uh it's not quite that because it doesn't actually synthesize the matter but it is specifically an advanced scientific model an AI model for Designing new materials and so in this case they're not so much looking to recreate the cup of tea as they are looking to help scientists discover new materials this is really in line with one of the things that Sam mman has laid out as a goal for when artificial intelligence has really crossed the Event Horizon when it's become something that is smarter than us uh and that is that it can discover its own new physics and so you're going to see a lot of push on Cutting Edge models in the next year or so and a lot of that is going to come around science so I'll be really curious curious to see sort of how matter genen evolves how it gets used I bet new materials get discovered this year it should be fun copy coder is really cool copy coder is back in the tools land it's not really agent based it's just a site where you can go and paste in a screenshot and understand how to prompt an AI assisted building tool to make what's in the screenshot and sometimes it's really hard to prompt prompting is a high leverage activity if you're prompting to build and you get it wrong can go off the rails fast so copy coder is really helpful for that finally synthesis synthesis is one of my favorite uses of AI so far synthesis is building an AI math tutor for kids and we know that you know AI helps with children's education if teachers are involved one of the things that just came out recently was a report and the paper is still being written out of an experiment that was done in subsaharan Africa where teachers were asked to build prompts for students in their class that were falling behind and they did so and they were able to see in just a few weeks a massive amount of catchup as the students work with those sort of custom chat GPT like tutors so there's a lot of opportunity there synthesis is going after it with math I'm excited as a parent all right that's the news for today cheers",

    "description": "My site: https://natebjones.com/\n My links: https://linktr.ee/natebjones\n My substack: https://natesnewsletter.substack.com/\nSynthesis: https://www.synthesis.com/tutor\nMattergen: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/mattergen-a-new-paradigm-of-materials-design-with-generative-ai/\nCopyCoder: https://copycoder.ai/\n\nTakeaways:\n 1. Agent Hype vs. Reality: While agents are overhyped, with some mislabeling basic tools as agents, platforms like AgentRecipes.com help clarify their true capabilities with clear visual examples and code snippets.\n 2. Market Signal Agents: \u201cWill You Pay for This\u201d showcases a genuine agent use case, curating market signals from X (formerly Twitter) by analyzing tweets and highlighting valuable insights for builders.\n 3. Scientific Breakthroughs with AI: Microsoft\u2019s MatterGen pushes boundaries by helping scientists discover new materials, paving the way for transformative innovations in material science.\n 4. Prompting Made Easier: Copycoder helps builders craft precise prompts by generating instructions from screenshots, streamlining AI-assisted building workflows.\n 5. AI-Driven Education: Synthesis\u2019s AI math tutor leverages teacher-guided AI prompts, inspired by real-world success stories, to help kids catch up in math quickly.\n 6. AI in Material Discovery: Cutting-edge AI models like MatterGen align with future goals of AI discovering new physics and scientific breakthroughs.\n 7. Educational AI Potential: Recent experiments in Sub-Saharan Africa show the potential of teacher-guided AI tutors to drive significant learning outcomes in underperforming students.\n\nQuotes:\n\u201cWe need better clarity on what agents can do, and sites like AgentRecipes.com help unpack their true potential.\u201d\n\u201cMatterGen isn\u2019t quite a Star Trek replicator, but it\u2019s a leap forward in using AI to discover groundbreaking materials.\u201d\n\u201cPrompting is a high-leverage activity, and getting it right is critical for building effectively with AI.\u201d\n\nSummary:\nAI tools and research are advancing rapidly, with significant updates across multiple areas. Agents are overhyped but hold real promise, as seen in tools like \u201cWill You Pay for This,\u201d which curates market signals from X. Microsoft\u2019s MatterGen is transforming material discovery with AI-driven innovation. Tools like Copycoder simplify AI-assisted building, while educational platforms like Synthesis leverage teacher-guided AI math tutors to drive student success. Experiments in Sub-Saharan Africa further validate AI\u2019s role in education. As AI evolves, its potential to reshape science, learning, and building workflows continues to expand.\n\nKeywords:\nagents, AgentRecipes.com, Will You Pay for This, Microsoft, MatterGen, AI material discovery, Copycoder, AI prompts, Synthesis, AI math tutor, Sub-Saharan Africa, education, builders, AI workflows, market signals, science, startups, innovation, future of AI, AI tools.",
