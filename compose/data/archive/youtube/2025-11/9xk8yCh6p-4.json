  "raw_transcript": "Let's say you have to complete a workflow and you're trying to go through and get all the steps in your workflow done at work and maybe it's a a building a product requirements document. You have to go through each of those stages and build it out. You have to get approvals and then you have to go back and talk to engineers. That is something that is not really changing. Now you may have AI help you do it faster, but the workflow itself is pretty stable. I want to suggest to you that one of the things that is a key for an entrepreneur is to look at the world in those kinds of terms. Look at the parts that swap out when you add more intelligence and look at the parts that stay steady. In this case, the workflow stays kind of steady. You're still going to have senior PMs wrestling with requirements, wrestling with engineering on technical requirements, wrestling with business stakeholders, and trying to figure it out and trying to make the workflow go together. I know this because I've lived it. Well, in that world, the workflow is a painoint that additional intelligence doesn't actually solve.",

    "description": "What\u2019s really happening with building an AI-powered side gig?\nThe usual advice is super generic: \"AI makes building a side gig easier than ever\"\u2014sure. \n\nBut HOW? What's the actual advantage now? Why? How do YOU leverage that advantage to build an AI side gig that actually stands a chance of making money?\n\nIn this video, I share the inside scoop on launching an AI-native side gig that actually ships:\n\u2022 Why LLMs open a short-lived micro-niche window\u2014and how to spot it.\n\u2022 How to choose distribution-first micro markets you already know and serve.\n\u2022 What tool stack ships fast: Lovable.dev, Outseta, Framer, Gemini\u2014no heroics.\n\u2022 Where to draw the line: ruthless scope, square-deal pricing, real traction.\n\nFor solo builders, the window is real but short; choose a niche you know, keep scope tight, and let distribution\u2014not features\u2014decide.\n\nSubscribe for daily AI strategy and news.\nFor deeper playbooks and analysis: https://natesnewsletter.substack.com/",
