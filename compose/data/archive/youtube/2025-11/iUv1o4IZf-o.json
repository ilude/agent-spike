  "raw_transcript": "you you are all about to have kind of like Luke Skywalker the ability to build your own lightsaber which is super cool but please be careful to build it right. Please be careful because the consequences are an insecure agent that generates production workloads that nobody has monitored or nobody has watched over, nobody's able to maintain when you're out and that generates ultimately organizational vulnerabilities. And as much as Chad GPT is going to lean on the safety guardrails, which are cool, it's not enough. It's organization's job to design agentic policies that actually scale. It's team's jobs to design agentic policies for teams that work for the whole team, not just the individual. And as an individual, it is your job to build the most scalable and sustainable agent you can. And that is what these principles are designed to do. Good luck with all the power you're about to be given.",

(Likely launching today)\n\nThe launch story seems to be \u201cpoint-and-click agents make everyone a builder\u201d \u2014 but the reality is a lot trickier.\n\nIn this video, I share the inside scoop on the new Agent Builder (leakded) plus, my hard-won principles on building reliable AI agents at production standards:\n\n\u2022 Why drag-and-drop agents change org behavior and security reviews.\n\u2022 How outcome-first design and proof of correctness prevent failures.\n\u2022 What \u201cdumb, deterministic\u201d multi-agent chains beat smart monoliths.\n\u2022 Where MCP tool choices, catalogs, and token burn go wrong.\n\nTakeaway: teams that adopt outcome-first, minimal-intelligence agents with tight prompts, structured retrieval, and a small, clear MCP tool dictionary will ship safely\u2014everyone else risks ambiguity, cost, and ungoverned workflows.\n\nChapters\n00:00 Introduction to OpenAI\u2019s Agent Builder\n02:42 Building Agents: Key Considerations\n05:40 Designing for Outcomes and Predictability\n08:10 Tool Choice and Management in Agent Building\n10:28 Organizational Standards for Agent Builds\n13:07 Final Thoughts on Agent Design and Best Practices\n\nSubscribe for daily AI strategy and news.\nFor deeper playbooks and analysis: https://natesnewsletter.substack.com/",
