  "raw_transcript": "in this video we're building the vital front end components for a postgress data analytics tool but just like our 100x Engineers of the future we're not typing this code we're prompting it in natural language using a technique I like to call Triple C we'll get into what exactly Triple C is but we're going to bring out what I believe is the best pair programming assistant right now we're going to use AER to show off this technique and give you ideas and add another tool to your toolbox to help you on your engineering journey to help you build your products to help you stay on the edge of AI engineering let's AI engineer our data analytics front-end MVP we're going to build this UI in three different Frameworks one of which I've never programmed with in my life so let's crack open vs code you can see I have two sets of terminals with three terminals each let's boot up our front end I'm using bun I'm going to leave all the documentation you need to get started with this in the description and of course the code is going to be in the description as well bun runev bun runev bun runev vew TS spell TS and react TS these are all generated using bun and Vite then we just cleared out a little bit of the application no big deal there we're working on the front end for talk to your database right this is the Prototype front end for the application that allows us to seamlessly interact with our postgress data analytics multi-agent tool that we've been building over the series feel free to look back check out all the videos we've done a lot of work so far I want to introduce you to something called Triple C Comet co-pilot coding let's boot up AER in each one of these applications copy this paste paste paste play play play okay let's go ahead and clear AER looks at your files to know what it needs in its context to start writing code we type SL add and for view we need app. viws add app. spell slad app. TSX you can see that right here perfect what is Comet co-pilot coding this technique is actually very simple you write comments you open AER and you ask AER to fill in the comments I'm going to come to the bottom of this VJs file I'm going to type code colon and then I'm going to start saying exactly what I want to happen here build a dark theme for input button pre section and code tag let's go ahead and create another right create two variables prompt string prompt result I'm going to say where prompt result equals some structure so that's going to be a record and that's going to be a string create an input field that updates variable and then right at the bottom we're going to say code create a list of the prompt results wrap. results in a scrollable pH section with a dark background I'm just feeling really verose with exactly what I want to see here that looks good so I have a couple comments here I'm just going to go ahead and let this rip so I'm going to save come into my view AER terminal read the comments and wherever you see code colon generate the request keep all code generation in the component right we're working with single file components in each one of these examples I going to keep it lock down just to these so that's done so I'm going to hit enter it's going to say that we have a code change that needs to be committed it's going to ask if you want to commit it I'm going to say yes I'm going to hit up and then rerun that request okay let's go ahead and make this a little larger and you can see AER doing its AER thing so it describing the changes we wanted to make it's walking through iteratively step by step right so it's showing the previous showing the new and it's already done so before I can even fully explain that it's finished it committed the changes it ran the changes it's now live in the file right right we have the interface that we asked for the prompt result typed exactly as we specified we have the two variables with perfect view3 script setup syntax we have the sections we have the input field setup with v model we have the section looping over our prompt results so you can see here this is working really well let's look at the front end we have this live we now have our enter your prompt input field right here right we can zoom in on this a little bit so this is good to go all we did was add a couple comments right I'm going to go ahead and get rid of these now added a couple comments and then we ran this exact prompt I'm going to go ahead and add this to the description as well there're going to be a couple different variants you can set up of course you can add your own you know code tag your code ID for AER for GPT to pick up it doesn't matter what you use as long as you use something consistently right this is how this works I'm going to go ahead and run this across the app felt and the app TSX right the nice part about ader I've mentioned this before but you can contrl Z and just go back in time I'm going to go ahead and copy out our comments here and then move back forward with control shift Z or command shift Z whatever you using based on your OS and I'm going to go to the spelt version just going to paste this right at the bottom and the app TSX version going to paste this right at the bottom as well and we're in TSX so you need to wrap this in another comment here right so that's that looks like I cut off this a little bit let me fix this there you go okay so now I'm going to let AER run this in the other two terminals one for spell and one for react committed the changes go ahead and run and now it's going to rip and as you can see here I think long term this is really the magic of prompt engineering in and Building multi-agent Systems to work alongside you and with you you can see here right now I am actively in two places at once really three places but I'm not currently doing anything right um so you can see these changes got committed let's go ahead and look at how they look so I've never worked with spelt I don't know what's going on I can of course make some sense of it it has this kind of cool three block style just like VJs we collapse everything you know script main style importing the icons you know one of the things I'm I really like about this technique this PR technique and using llms in general is that while I'm using this I actively learning spell I don't know how it works exactly but we can kind of see right we have this each block which you know we can assume will Loop over then we have this prompt as results so you know list and then iterative value and then we can see that getting placed and we have the prompt results and then we have the type so this looks really clean it looks a lot like view that's really awesome let's look at the react version you can see here we have the exact same thing we have the prompt result we we have two State variables we have the input with the onchange event setting the state and then we have a nice Loop let's go ahead and get rid of the comments here let's go ahead and tweak this a little bit this is a little off we need to push this down copilot is not going to be perfect it's getting close so sometimes you need to make a little tweak just like that let's hop over to the applications we can see three versions view version spell version and we have the react TS version looks like the react version gave us a little button there that's kind of interesting so this is great let's keep moving let's keep pushing this over the series we've been building a postgress data analytics tool that allows us to accept a natural language query generate SQL and run it against database right now we're going to hit our first kind of mock API that we have set up in our server directory we have two new directories here we have the clients where we have our react felt and view front ends then we have our server which has our postr dat Analytics tool kind of a strip down version just to get something live so we can experiment with it right so now we have this API we can hit let's go ahead and open up one more terminal which has our server in it and I'm just going to CD into server going to start a python environment python API index. py so this is running a versal flask application really minimalistic the application looks something like this we have our postgress database URL our open AI key we have this cores request helper just so that we can quickly make API requests and then here's the meat of it we have this SL prompt post endpoint right we're doing a little bit of cores work up here and then as you've seen before in the series we have our postgress agent instruments opening up functions and state that we can use and our postgress database instance rep puring out tables from our SQL database or pining the tables to a prompt we're then setting up our small two agent system to generate SQL and then run it against our database using open AI tools and then at the bottom we're reading those files out and we're returning this object which we're going to pass back to the front end right using our AI pair programming tool let's go ahead and generate this request on the Fly let's start with the vue.js version so I'm going to write right here just like we have been code colon and I'm going to ask for exactly what I want add a enter key event that takes the prompt and makes a HTTP post request Local Host 3000 SL prompt the Json response into the prompt results make sure to use json.parse it will be a Json string so just like before I'm just going to run the exact same prompt to AER this is kind of a magical thing constantly firing the same prompt while updating exactly what I want to change in the code I think this might be a pattern we see going forward as AI coding assistence uh develop and as you know the big guys Microsoft you know with their co-pilot and smaller startups really trying to tackle this problem I think we're going to see something like this a lot more right where you have these like smaller insets of prompt engineering I've kind of designed a whole product around this of course haven't gotten to it don't have enough time but let's go ahead and just run this right okay we need to make another commit go ahead and say yes and then rerun okay okay so you can see AER is talking through the change it's showing everything that already exists and then it's generating the new code so it's doing this right now okay so we do we do run into this issue so this is a problem that I've run into a couple times with this technique you've probably seen this too where AER whatever tool you're using really GPT as well they'll write code for you but they'll do this import existing block and they'll just delete the rest of your code right so this is something that I think um needs to be improved let's go ahead and hit contrl Z do a little bit of time travel let's get our previous block just go ahead and just copy your previous script block and then move forward again and jump down to the script paste that in and also I noticed it looks like it's generating two script blocks so again not perfect it's still getting there I'm going go ahead and remove the previous script block find our new script block get that out of the template and bam we're good to go so let's look at the change right key up. enter this is exactly how you do this in view you have send prompt and it has this new function for us check and see if the prompt is empty if it is return and then it's making this post request for us right hitting SL prompt parsing this out parsing the Json just like we said data. results needs to be checked and parsed Via from Json and then we reset the value and push into our prompt results list we've been looking at the code a lot let's go to the front end I'm going to hit refresh here this is the latest version our server is up and running on Port 3K let's just type in natural language let's see if AER and gbd turbo helped us put this UI together faster than ever before so I'm going to type all unoff users and hit enter okay so let's check this out so we have our prompt at the top all unoff users we can see we have a nice list of results and then we have our SQL statement so you know we can check the back end here looks like we have a big print here this is the all the content coming from the response object from our postgress database um but this is really great so all unoff the users so if we you know just real quick Copy this paste this in a file we should see all of our users um not off so you know if I look for for uh regex uh search you know off to false that looks good and if I look for True here we'll see nothing so that worked perfectly and you know just like that we kind of have a nice jump start to this user interface let's go ahead and impr prompt again right all users with job feedback. rating less than three let's hit enter of course there's a lot more UI improvements we can make here but let's let our server run okay let's go ahead and scroll down let's see how this looks okay this looks good so we have couple it it here you can see it corrected my mistake here so I said job feedback L that got autof fixed for me which is great um and it just kind of put this together so this is great this is working the VJs version is looking decent let's go ahead and just add this prompt to our other two versions right our our spelt and our react version so let's go ahe and do that right now so in the in the spelt version I'm going to try pasing this right at the top to see if it can make sure it reads all of the code below it and I'm going to do the same thing for the react version now we have that comment in both versions right at the top let's see how this works again really cool part about this functionality you just take this line and you keep running it all you're doing is in line updating your code and then you just blast this prompt to AER over and over so let's go ahead and run that let's go ahead and run it here and here and as you can see that really cool like parallel feeling where you know feels like we're getting a lot of work done and as this progress as we learn how to use these tools we will be getting a lot more done because just like that in two code bases essentially I've made two changes simultaneously with one prompt right so let's go ahead and see how this worked so this is the spelt version again I don't really know spelt so I'm kind of just you know going by gut feel going by my coding senses you know my coding experience um but this is also really cool so we have handle key down okay it did add another script Buck here kind of annoying right uh not perfect so let's go ahead and just copy this out and now we have what looks like a Onkey down Handler so Onkey down Handler calls this function we're checking for the enter key key and then just like in the VJs version it's running that same HTTP request right this is really clean really slick and as you can see here AER only has context of the one file we're operating in right let's go ahead and see how this looks so here's the VJs version and here's the spelt version get all unof users let's get off users instead right hit enter let this load let the back end get a nice response for us and let's see how the SP version looks okay so nothing happened our prompt did get cleared so we do know that this last line is running you know something's going on here so let's go ahead and make a more specific prompt to see what's going on and I I think I can already see what's happening right we have a DOT push here and my guess is that something is not being reactive right so let's go ahead hop AER The Prompt results St push is not updating anything please address go ahead and commit our previous changes hit yes rerun okay nice to address this issue with prompt. push not updating we need to ensure that spell is aware of the update and the prompts result to trigger reactivity you need to use a race spread okay yeah so classic reactivity and a framework so go ahead we're just going to spread the object over let's go ahead let's jump back to the front end and see if that worked so all off users awesome so as we can see here we have all off users so that was our prompt and then we have a nice list here a not scrolled list which is you know kind of missed that but that's fine so we have a nice list here of all the results and then at the bottom we have our SQL queries probably move the SQL query above the list whatever that's one prompt away from happening uh but this is working let's go ahead and look at our react version looks like we got a little error here let's go ahead and check that out looks like the react version uh thre some of the functionality right inside the component so again not perfect still needs some work we can just copy this out though paste this above before our component definition for our jsx and that is looking a lot better and let's prompt in our react t c s version so all off users with jobs that have status completed okay so I'm going to hit enter there that should prompt Also let's go ahead and check the server to make sure it's running up so our server is running here you can see it's Incorporated the jobs table and it has the base prompt all off users okay and it has results there so let's go and look at this awesome so we have our list of results here we have our select statement here and let's just go ahead and like look at this statement so select distinct great enter jooin jobs great parent ID so great so it found that relationship between the job and the users table and then it said status complete and user is off so perfect that is absolutely the statement we can see that we're missing the prompt here in this version let's just throw AER at that let's say update the results list UI to also show The Prompt of course commit the changes let's go ahead and run that and should be a fairly simple change just need to update that cool so that was applied let's goad and look at our list you can see here we now have prompt getting placed in the TSX let's go ahead and perfect so already there right another fantastic part about AER it just saves your file for you automatically right away so really cool you know we could add another prompt here make sure you clear out the input you can add another prompt for uh getting a little bit better formatting we can add some defaults let's do something else let's do something a little more complex right I'm going to hop back over to the VJs version and you know we have this list of items but if we refresh in every version we lose our state right so so in the production version of course we're going to have this behind a nice server with a nice database behind it for right now let's just experiment some more with ader and let's just add this to local storage let's go ahead and flex our AI coding skills a little more here I'm going to create a comment right above the state in VJs and I'm going to say code colon load this from local storage or default to empty list and then when we save I'm going to say comment code colon save this to local storage exactly so this is kind of funny right we have uh Microsoft co-pilot helping us co-pilot AER okay so that's done let's go ahead and clear this up we're just going to hit up we're going to rerun the exact same prompt it's going to ask if we need to commit our changes which we will we'll say yes we'll hit up again and hit enter and now it's going to make this change for us it should load from local storage and save to local storage so if we refresh we should see these changes persist let's go ahead and look great so we have local storage set item and we have prompt results Json stringify going in there great let's search upward and make sure that perfect in our reference here in view we're going to be parsing the local storage parse or parsing in empty array right okay so I've just refreshed The View TS version so let's just say get all jobs that have failed status let's hop over to our server we can see this running base prompt there's the response already back and Bam now we have all jobs with the failed status let's go ahead and just refresh right now and as you can see we do have the refresh running right here our changes are persisting let's go ahead set up the exact same thing for our spelt and react versions okay so now we have the spelt version with the co-pilot comment there one here one here save prompt to local storage load this from local storage same thing in the react version right at the US state call load from local storage and save prompt results to local storage let's fire these off in the respective versions let's go ahead and say yes to commit rerun The Prompt and we'll let it rip all right let's just go right to the front end let's run a prompt in this felt version get all users with created after sept 2023 let's let that run there's all users created after September 2023 you see here we have 2023 and 10 if we just search that we should see no records at N9 we can go ahead and look for 09 here and that looks perfect right so select everything after September and if we hit refresh we have it in local storage fantastic one more test test let's go to our react version we'll say get all jobs created in sept 2023 let that run if we hop over to the server we can see that this is indeed running live right now and we're going to get our results pretty quickly here awesome and let's look so here we have a react version of all of our results created in September 2023 so you can see here where jobs created greater than and created less than perfect and if we just scroll through that we can see that those results are coming through and and right so so this is a really cool technique I've been using to build applications faster than I ever have before there's this really powerful feeling you get when you're using AI coding tools like ader where you're running a prompt and it's writing code for you in one file and one set of files and then you're off somewhere else also writing code planning designing architecting something and then you come back it's complete sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't it's all going to improve remember it's about the direction of where this is going going add this tool to your toolbox I'm a huge fan of ader I'm a huge fan of all the work that Paul has been doing he's really built a fantastic application I think it is really the mold of in editor in terminal AI coding assistance that uh everyone should really be paying attention to so again add it to your toolbox this is an incredible tool now I wanted to go into a little bit of detail in hosting but I figure that's not a really great use of our time talking about deploying backends there's there's tons of content already really that cover that we don't need to talk about that and in reality when we put our postgress data analytics tool talk to your database behind a API behind a server it's going to be a real kind of heavier heavy duty scalable solution it's going to be AWS gcp you know and it there's going to be a lot more complexity I just want to show this off a little bit to show where this is all going show off some of the capabilities and you know get this hosted so this is ready to go in a versal application so this can be hosted using versal I'm going to leave of of course links in the description so that you can get to setup and running that's all going to be available there there are low code Solutions there are no code Solutions but they all lose that fine grain capability of full control over your code full control over your product there's definitely a place for low code and no code but I want to make you aware of these capabilities and I want to you know keep bringing it up on my channel uh because these tools are really important I know there's open Terminal I've heard of chat Dev I've heard of all these other ones um I've tried a decent amount of them they're they're all fairly good I'm I'm looking at these tools constantly comparing contrasting seeing which ones give me a bigger Edge a bigger lead in my engineering and product building skills and you know ability to create valuable products AER is just swipe the board there are definitely some improvements that can be made to some of these prompts to get it to you know deliver code more accurately you can give it more templated section so that it knows you know don't duplicate the script tag we saw that happen a couple times right just just like you saw here I'm using it to build out the front end of talk to your database feel free to sign up this is what the series has been leading up to all 10 videos is about us starting from nothing to building a full Complete product over the next two videos we're going to push our AI coding assistance even further we're going to build out more of our frontend user interfaces we're going to lock into one of these Frameworks we're going to clean this up a little bit and the whole time we're going to use co-pilot and we're going to hit our mock back in API and we're going to treat this like a real production application all with the backbone of llm GPT power technology that is changing the way that we engineer it's changing the way that we write code it's changing the way that we interact with our data with our databases feel free to like feel free to sub join the journey we're staying on the edge of air engineering it doesn't matter who's the CEO of what company it doesn't matter the tool or technology we stick to core fundamental engineering principles to help us make high probability decisions on where to spend our time where to spend our energy where to spend our life as Engineers we're going to be here as long as it is possible for us to be here before AI fully takes over we have a lot of time left I don't want to sound like a Doomer but the time is coming let's stay on the edge let's keep our Edge as Engineers alive as long as possible I'll see you guys in the next video",
