  "raw_transcript": "progress is demonstrabably continuing at exponential rates. We have in any benchmark that is not saturated is showing continued strong gains. I think my favorite is MER right now because it just doesn't have a top. All it does is it measures how long a task takes a good human and then it says can an AI do it 50% of the time. Now, I'm the first one to say 50% is a low bar, but at least it's a consistent bar. And we keep showing exponential gains on that as a use cases get stronger. And we're not bottoming out. That's not slowing down. We keep doubling every few months. Number fourth, we are still underallocated on chips. In in the same interviews that got blown up around the world around AI and bubbles, Sam admitted he could release a smarter model, but he lacks the chips to do it. Anthropic is also famously underallocated on chips. Everyone's using them for coding and they just can't get enough chips.",

    "description": "My site: https://natebjones.com\nMy substack: https://natesnewsletter.substack.com/\nThe story: https://open.substack.com/pub/natesnewsletter/p/ai-bubble-why-the-doom-narrative?r=1z4sm5&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&showWelcomeOnShare=true\n\nTakeaways\n 1. Narrative Swings Drive Bubble Talk: A mix of hype disappointment (GPT-5 rollout), layoffs, and Sam Altman\u2019s \u201cbubble\u201d comment created the perfect conditions for a doom narrative.\n 2. Chatbot Plateau: The chat interface is reaching saturation\u2014further model improvements won\u2019t feel as dramatic to end users.\n 3. Progress Shifts to Agentic Use Cases: Real breakthroughs are happening in complex workflows and proofs, but these are harder to grasp than chatbot gains.\n 4. Benchmarks Show Exponential Gains: Non-saturated benchmarks like METR still demonstrate accelerating AI capability growth.\n 5. Chip Scarcity Reflects Demand: Both OpenAI and Anthropic admit they\u2019re under-allocated on chips, showing strong underlying demand, not weakness.\n 6. Restructuring = Refocusing: Meta\u2019s layoffs are less about retreat than reorganizing around inference and next-stage gains.\n 7. Power Law Dynamics: AI investment and returns follow power laws, rewarding outsized bets and forcing firms to specialize in their niches.\n\nQuotes\n\u201cWe are in a world where model makers are showing exponential gains in model performance and we are very early in seeing how that lands with business.\u201d\n\u201cIf it really was a bubble, we wouldn\u2019t all be complaining about it\u2014instead, we would all be hyping it up.\u201d\n\u201cWith any gold rush you get people rushing in to stake a claim, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s inherently a bubble.\u201d\n\nSummary\nThe current AI \u201cbubble\u201d narrative is driven by hype swings, layoffs, and public comments, but the reality is more nuanced. While chatbots are plateauing, progress continues in harder-to-see agentic use cases. Benchmarks show exponential gains, demand for chips is still outstripping supply, and corporate restructurings signal refocus rather than retreat. AI adoption is a power law game: most projects fail, but the successes deliver existential 10x returns, making heavy investment rational. Far from an AI winter, we are entering a phase where the biggest value will come from specialized, high-impact business use cases beyond chat.\n\nKeywords\nAI bubble, GPT-5, Sam Altman, MIT study, enterprise AI, agentic use cases, Meta layoffs, chip scarcity, exponential benchmarks, METR, power law dynamics, AI investment, Anthropic, OpenAI, business AI adoption, AI winter",
