  "raw_transcript": "Number four. Number four. Ha. Structured output is a baseline. So stop asking just for thoughts. Demand scorecards. Ask for matrices. Ask for tables if you're in 03. I'm just kidding. It will give you tables anyway. Ask for phased plans. Ask for structured outputs in your document. Whatever it is. The more specificity you give in the output, the more it's going to give you what you are looking for. I don't think this is necessarily new. We've started to talk about this for a while, but we haven't put it in the context of GPT5. GPT5 is going to reinforce the value of those best practice prompt architectures. Let's look at prompt designs. You need to have an interrogative principle. The best prompts expect the model to ask questions. I would assume GPT5 will take some of what OpenAI practiced in deep research and we'll ask questions.",

    "description": "The post: https://open.substack.com/pub/natesnewsletter/p/ready-for-chatgpt-5-grab-a-complete?r=1z4sm5&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&showWelcomeOnShare=true\n\nMy site: https://natebjones.com/\nMy links: https://linktr.ee/natebjones\nMy substack: https://natesnewsletter.substack.com/\n\nTakeaways\n 1. Extreme Specificity Focuses Models: The tighter your word counts, formats, and numbered requirements, the sharper ChatGPT-5 (and today\u2019s models) will perform.\n 2. Context Is Currency: With context windows racing toward the million-token mark, front-load full documents, history, and constraints\u2014just keep every byte relevant.\n 3. Multi-Phase Workflows Go Native: Stop treating step-by-step prompts as hacks; GPT-5 will natively traverse multi-stage thinking and creation inside a single run.\n 4. Structured Output by Default: Demand scorecards, matrices, phased plans, or XML tags\u2014clear schemas unlock more reliable reasoning and easier downstream use.\n 5. Interrogative & Self-Check Loops: Great prompts encourage the model to ask clarifying questions and critique its own answers before you ever hit \u201csend.\u201d\n 6. Project-Manager Chunking: Break massive research into smaller deliverables, synthesize later, and iterate\u2014Agile-style prompting scales with expanding context windows.\n\nQuotes\n\u201cWe\u2019re moving from asking if AI can help to architecting a true partnership.\u201d\n\u201cSpecificity isn\u2019t a cage; it\u2019s the fine brush that paints your vision on an LLM canvas.\u201d\n\u201cContext windows are exploding\u2014treat every token like jet fuel for focused reasoning.\u201d\n\nSummary\nI argue that you can prepare for ChatGPT-5 today by refining how you prompt current frontier models. The next wave will reward extreme specificity, rich but relevant context, and multi-phase workflows executed in one shot. Structured outputs, interrogative prompts, and built-in self-evaluation loops will become table stakes. As context windows balloon toward millions of tokens, effective prompting shifts from magic phrases to precise architecture: clear goals, constraints, and chunked tasks. Prompts are thinking tools that shape both the model\u2019s reasoning and my own, forging a bidirectional partnership that scales human creativity rather than replacing it.\n\nKeywords\nChatGPT-5, prompting, extreme specificity, context windows, multi-phase workflows, structured output, self-evaluation loops, interrogative prompts, AI partnership, Wayne Gretzky, project-manager chunking, million-token context, AI architecture, prompt design, frontier models",
