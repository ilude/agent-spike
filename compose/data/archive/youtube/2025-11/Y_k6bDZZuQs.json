  "raw_transcript": "It's spicy take time. I want to share a spicy take on where product is going. And no, it has nothing to do with AIdriven product discovery getting shortened by tools like lovable. I've heard that take. I think it's true. I just think it's been overtalked about. I want to share something a little bit more controversial. I think that we may need to change some of our core artifacts when it comes to product and engineering collaboration because AI is making it so efficient to translate and deliver information back and forth. And so I think that a lot of our old artifacts assume it's really hard to convey meaning. So the PRD product requirements document, it's written specifically so that an engineer can read it in a certain way. The one pager is written specifically so the business can read it in a certain way. The test cases that we write for QA are written specifically so that quality assurance can read it in a certain way. The press release we may write if you're from a certain tradition like Amazon, same deal. You get the idea. artifacts written with the assumption that they are human readers. You have to write for a human audience. This is deliberately provocative. I'm not saying we all live into this world today. But I want you to think about the idea of jump jumping all of that, leapfrogging all of it and getting to the end of the process. And I asked myself that question. What does it look like to leaprog away from this idea of the definition of done for a PM being like an artifact produced that then gets turned into a product and then the definition of done at the end is like launching the product. Well, how do you how do you jump to the end of that with AI in a way that's efficient? My proposal for you is that the way to do that is actually to have the documentation for the customer become a core artifact in the product development process. So think about it. If you write excellent docs like Stripe does and you have an extraordinary degree of fidelity in those docs, maybe it's a technical product and you have highderee fidelity and technical docs, maybe it's a less technical product, but the docs are still very very good for your audience. What more do you need? Imagine it. You write an excellent prompt. You understand what you need to build so well that you can actually write extraordinary docs as a PM. You can derive a user interface off of docs. You can derive technical requirements off of docs if they're written well enough. you can derive the reason why you're building this off of docs because they are so clear about the user experience. And maybe that's what I'm getting at. The heart of this is that the prompt allows us to move to a world where the LLM is doing the translation back and forth between different contexts. And we are the ones who are simply providing taste and intent. I know that's a provocative idea. I'm not saying that tomorrow we're going to get to a world where PMs are going to just write a prompt, understand what they want to build so clearly that they can get to excellent docs that are prompt driven, polish those docs till they shine, and then engineers will be able to just derive technical requirements off of it, and we'll be able to derive a business case. I'm not. It's always going to be more complicated than that. But as a thinking exercise, I think it's really helpful because I think it pushes us to stop assuming that AI disruption is only happening at the top of the development funnel, which is where a lot of PMs have stopped right now. Uh, and I think it it pushes us to think about the end product more. the way we can shortcut to customer value with AI. And I think if you really want to be disruptive and get ahead of where AI is going, that is the kind of thinking that you have to practice. You have to start asking yourself where is the end customer value here. If we've been making all of these documents under this outdated assumption that humans need to read it, maybe we need to stop doing that because maybe human understanding only matters at certain points in the workflow and maybe we can derive that more efficiently in other ways. And so for me, I think that I am going about halfway into that world right now. I think it's an experimentation thing. I am starting to play with the idea that any product document needs to include docs. If you're going to present a PRD to an engineer, they should be able to imagine and understand the world that you want to create through the help docs and the onboarding docks and the guidelines that are going to get the customer into it. It should be that clear. they should be able to click in and say, \"Okay, I can onboard this way.\" Uh, and these are the edge cases that we're covering in the help docs, and this is the FAQ section in the help docs, etc. And by the way, I think if you write that well, it maps really cleanly onto good product requirements. And so, I actually don't know that it's a ton more work. I'll leave it there. I I think that I would like to get a conversation going that goes past what feels like the tired edge of the conversation right now because the conversation right now honestly with product management and engineers and design and AI is obsessed with the top of the funnel. It's obsessed with wow can we get more disruption and more optionality and more rapid prototyping at the top of the funnel. And I have talked with PMs who are like, well, this this just makes the top of the funnel really fat and we have no way to actually refine and execute and build efficiently out of that. And I know that tools like cursor help a bit, but we don't really have a systematized way as a community of driving that workflow forward to production. And I think I want to push for that kind of a conversation. And so this is a thinking exercise. Push back, challenge, suggest better ways to do it. But at the end of the day, we need to be thinking about the final results and how we can more efficiently drive product execution to launch and not just product ideation, which is I feel like where most of our AI thinking is going right now. And I think it's it's not correct. I think it's not the the only way to think about what AI can do. Cheers.",

    "description": "My site: https://natebjones.com/\nMy links: https://linktr.ee/natebjones\nMy substack: https://natesnewsletter.substack.com/\n\nTakeaways\n 1. Docs as Core Artifact: Customer-facing documentation can replace the traditional PRD, press release, and QA matrix because LLMs now handle context-switching between audiences.\n 2. AI Collapses Translation Costs: When models instantly translate intent into functional specs, the costly human hand-offs those artifacts were designed to bridge become optional.\n 3. PRD-Era Assumptions Obsolete: Legacy deliverables assume meaning is hard to convey; AI upends that premise and demands leaner, outcome-oriented workflows.\n 4. Docs-Driven Derivation: Precise docs let models spin up UI mocks, API contracts, test cases, and even business rationales\u2014turning prose into multipurpose source code.\n 5. Customer Value Lens: Shifting effort to end-user documentation forces PMs to clarify value early and anchor every decision in the customer\u2019s day-one experience.\n 6. Experimentation Path Forward: Writing help and onboarding docs first exposes edge-case fuzziness sooner, creating a feedback loop that sharpens thinking and accelerates launch.\n\nQuotes\n\u201cMaybe the only artifact that matters is documentation so good the product builds itself.\u201d\n\u201cThe definition of done could be excellent docs, not a stack of siloed deliverables.\u201d\n\u201cStop stuffing the funnel\u2014use AI to collapse it and ship value faster.\u201d\n\nSummary\nI argue that the artifacts product teams rely on\u2014PRDs, one-pagers, test cases\u2014exist mainly because translating intent between humans is slow. With LLMs removing that friction, the only artifact worth perfecting may be customer-facing documentation. If docs describe the experience with enough precision, models can derive UIs, technical specs, and business cases automatically, letting humans focus on taste and intent. This shift reframes product management as docs-first storytelling rather than bureaucracy, collapses hand-offs, and directs AI energy toward shipping value instead of bloating the ideation funnel. Experimenting now with docs-driven workflows surfaces gaps, sharpens vision, and accelerates launch velocity and momentum.\n\nKeywords\nproduct management, AI translation, documentation-first, PRD replacement, docs-driven development, LLM workflow, customer value, artifact shift, agile execution, spicy take",
