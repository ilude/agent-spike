  "raw_transcript": "the 100x llm is coming it's not a question of if it's a question of when this entire video is based off a single question I have for you are you ready for a 100x Improvement in soda llms and state-of-the-art large language models after I heard Sam Alman talk about two different types of startups one group that's likely to win and the other that's likely to lose I couldn't get this idea out of my head because I realized I had no plan for the next iteration of llms the 100x Improvement I'll play that clip in just a second but first I want to highlight how insane 100x is take a look at this dot This Is Us right now this is your best prompts your best AI agents your best agentic workflows built on top of the best state-of-the-art models we're talking about gp4 we're talking about Claude three Opus we're talking about Gemini Pro and this is every tool that you have available to you right now right this is Devon this is cursor this is ader this is fi data this is L graph it's everything okay but everything we have right now is essentially nothing take a look at this line here at the top of the screen this is what a 100x Improvement looks like to scale you cannot even see a fourth of the entire circle this is absolutely incredible but this is what we're dealing with this is where we are right now and this is a 100x this is gp4 CLA opus all of our current agentic tooling and this is what it looks like 100x we don't know when this is coming we don't know if it's going to be gbg4 GPT for Ultra or if it will even come from open AI it's looking like it will but that is not important I don't care about that what I care about is helping you prepare for this the 100x Improvement in soda models and state-of-the-art llms all of your capabilities are going to 100x I think fundamentally there are two strategies to build on AI right now there's one strategy which is assume the model is not going to get better and then you kind of like build all these little things on top of it and then there's another strategy which is build assuming that open air is going to stay on the same rate of trajectory and the models are going to keep getting better at the same Pace it would seem to me that 95% of the world should be betting on the latter category but a lot of the startups have been built in the former category but there's a giant set of startups where you benefit from gp5 being way better ask what company whether uh 100x Improvement in the model is something they're excited about so in this video I want to do one thing I want to move you from not prepared to prepared for a 100x and again it doesn't matter when this happens you want to be ready before the ball starts rolling you want to get and maintain your first movers advantage in the age of AI in the age of llms so that's it that's all we're doing in this video I going to help you move from not prepared to prepared for the 100x Improvement in SA state-of-the-art large language models so what are these three ways to prepare how have I constructed this into actions that I am personally taking every single day to prepare for 100x how can these ideas be useful for you we're looking at three tactics three practices I have three concrete practices for you let's dive into them we're talking about baps we're talking about expanding your problem set and we're going to end with 100 p over D you can guess what the p is we're going to get to 100 p over D let's start with the most important highest impact actions you can take first because why waste time the Bap is the big ass prompt I cannot take credit for this one a commenter on one of the videos on the channel came up with this terminology ever since I read that comment this terminology has stuck with me so what is a bab a bab is a large prompt with 10K to 1 mil tokens all right so we're talking about a large prompt filled up with your unique domain specific data and knowledge okay so why is this important why focusing on big ass problems help us prepare for the 100x Improvement baps allow you to solve bigger problems in a single shot when you're using a BAP you can utilize your data at scale with the power of the llm and last but not least you can discover the full potential of context filled prompts think about it this way when you run a prompt with two or three sentences with with your error that you just got that you're trying to resolve and your current block of code when you ask your llm how to resolve a get merge for the 5 millionth time what you're doing there is it's it's the equivalent of it sitting in the garage and only getting driven a few hours every single week and when you do drive it you drive it at the very fastest 60 MPH right that's the equivalent of what's Happening Here we are not utilizing our prompts to their full capability by using big ass prompts you can really discover the potential of your context filled prompts that's what a BAP is it's a prompt with the contexts filled with your unique data I can almost guarantee you you are going to find and discover new different ways and new capabilities of the current state-of-the-art large language models that you were not aware of dump in a large section or even your entire code base take your database dump it in the prompt run OCR on a PDF and dump the whole thing in there I brought this up before but everyone is way too focused on outside of the prompt problems like Rag and like organizing data with knowledge graphs and whatnot that's important but over time it will become less and less important as the context window increases as accuracy goes up as needle in the hay stack accuracy goes through the roof rag is one of those problems that Sam is talking about that they are going to solve don't focus on rag fill up your prompt I realize it's going to cost it's going to be a little expensive but it's time to start practicing now remember the cost of the prompt is going to zero and remember the prompt is the new fundamental unit of knowledge work and programming so you need to get your reps in now before this stuff is widely available on the channel we focused a lot on being ready before it's time this is the key of great engineering this is what expertise is it's knowing what's going to happen and preparing for it so that you can have that first movers Advantage all right so that's what a BAP is this is really important if you do nothing else if you take nothing else away from this video start using big ass prompts fill up the context use context fil prompts take your data and truly use it to drive results and solve your problems so what's next expand your problem set what does this mean how can this help us prepare for the 100x Improvement in llms so solve problems with your prompts and AI agents that you're not ready for or that you're not sure about and solve problems that you're just not tackling right I can almost guarantee you that there's something some process some development workflow in your day that you haven't taken the time to sit down and say how would I have an llm do this for me how can I build a couple of AI agents chained together to solve this one task for me don't get caught up and exactly how you'll accomplish the goal just start solving the problem with basic prompts and a few tools so why do we care about this why do we care about expanding our problem set and solving problems with prompts and AI agents because it's important to understand your problems intimately and understand if they're solvable with current models and current chaining techniques I I can almost guarantee you whatever problem you're thinking about whatever that task is that you haven't attacked yet that you haven't started digging into it is solvable by current state-of-the-art llms and a couple of great prompt chains I can almost guarantee you that in the off chance that you're really pushing it and you're really near the edge the 100x model and the iterations up to it will boost your existing solution and help you unlock it but you need to have your problem ready for prime time again I want to tap into the idea that expertise is really about knowing what's coming next and being ready for it right having a best guess and having action so that when the opportunity presents itself when the next generation of models come you are ready you have your problem sitting there ready for prime time it's important to aggressively tackle existing problems with prompts LM power tools and AI agents if you're still writing code line by line I'm calling you out right now you are starting the self-deprecation process for yourself as an engineer you need to be prompting your code you need to be prompting your documentation you need to be prompting your feedback you need to be prompting everything on this channel we've set some micr Trends in the you know llm Tech ecosystem that's amazing if I get credit for nothing I want to get credit for this line for this statement The Prompt is the new fundamental unit of programming and of knowledge work you need to be utilizing this stuff because that is the landscape shift on a more lower level forget about the 100x for a second on a lower level that is how you prepare for all of these LM power tools it's all about the prompt Master The Prompt Master knowledge work Master The Prompt Master programming and of course I know it's not that simple of course you need to know how to code you need to know the fundamentals you need to know algorithms data structures but with the power of the prompt in your hand you can do all of these things you can learn all of these things okay so anyway I don't want to sound too preachy there but it's important to aggressively tackle your existing problems with prompts llm power tools and AI agents I know right now you're thinking of a couple things that you can start tackling right now it's time this is your call to action solve those problems get ahead of the curve and stay ahead of the curve if you're enjoying these ideas so far and they make sense and you can see how these tactics can help you prepare for the 100x hit the like hit the sub this is the content that can help you evolve your engineering and maybe you're one of the engineers that are already taking these steps right you know the power of a big ass prompt you know that you can load up tons of documentation four prompts and have a brand new specifications document built out or maybe you've built out some system that starts prototyping for you and lines everything up perfectly because it has all of your unique domain specific data from your database from your CSV from your Json file and it's helping you make those changes to your codebase to your work to your products so if you know what I'm talking about just hit the like and you know continue being awesome continue on the ride for everyone else you're you're in the right place you're focused on the right things remember to aggressively tackle existing problems with prompts llm power tools and AI agents let's move on to the last tactic you can practice to prepare for the 100x Improvement in state-of-the-art llms 100 prompts a day 100 p over D this one sounds dumb it sounds obvious but it is so so so important what do great Engineers do they write code they communicate clearly they build they fix they maintain and they do it over and over and over and over again right right we have a mental model of what's likely to come and what we need to do to create certain outcomes and that comes from raw experience from putting in the Reps for prompt engineering for building AI agents the reps are prompts if you're using some prompt design tool if you're using an AI coding assistant and even if you're just going raw right into chat GPT or hitting their API or running some agentic workflow it all counts as a prompt if you want to transform into an agentic engine engineer you need to hit your prompts you need to get your reps in right understand the present to understand the future the big takeaway from this is that by running a ton of prompts to solve different problems you can understand what's possible with current llms if you don't know what you can do right now I can guarantee you when the 100x comes you will not know what to do with yourself so get the practice in if you want to understand the future you need to understand the present practice practice practice this is how expertise occurs don't listen to anyone else saying anything about how you can improve at a skill there's nothing else to it other than practice and reflection I snort llms like it is crack as someone who is completely obsessed and addicted to llms and the power of this technology I can almost guarantee you you are not likely even near the limits of existing models prompts and prompt chains right and all the way up right all the way up to agentic workflows the amount of latent value here that is ready for you to tap into is incredible it is absolutely insane and to imagine it 100 exing is truly kind of just completely mind-blowing but in order to be ready for that to best prepare for that you need to get your reps in you need to solve existing problems you need to understand what the current limits are really truly understand them at a deep fundamental level this is why I have slowly kind of phased out um using AI Li liaries in a lot of my code it's because they're taking the magic away from you they're taking the understanding of what it means to create a great prompt chain or to create a very specific accurate prompt don't give that power away to a library right now it's way too soon just way too soon I'll pop that comment up on the screen this is likely worth an entire video to explain why I don't use tools like Lang graph Len chain autogen fi data crei there there are a bunch of like really really great llm kind of AI agent AI assistant tools emerging I recommend you hold off as much as you can don't use them quite yet keep writing the prompts keep building your own tooling and then if and when you understand what's going on then pick up one of those tools I'm really impressed with a lot of the functionality they're building out it's nothing against the tool itself it's the fact that the prompt is the most important thing and you shouldn't be handing that off to a library this early in the game there's still too much to be decided so anyway so 100 prompts a day this this is ultra important and this concludes three ways you can prepare for a 100x Improvement in soda llms and state-of-the-art large language models use baps get your domain specific knowledge and data into your prompts build up tooling that lets you quickly do that expand your problem set there are problems tools and products you have been thinking about building this is your call to action this is your CTA to start solving those problems now it is time to attack those problems you need to know what is possible you need to know where the limits are you will be able to solve the existing problems that you have with current state-of-the-art llms expand your problem set is also about solving the problems in your current development workflow and your current product workflow that you have that you haven't started implementing llm based Solutions in right build out the AI agent that helps you review your code build out the agent that helps you write documentation faster build out the agent that helps you peer review faster right it's time to start digging into all this get your tools in place get everything ready because the 100x is coming it's not a question of if it's a question of when and then lastly of course no one great became great by not putting in the work all right like there's just no way around this I recommend you aim for 100 prompts a day this is how we evolve into the next level of software engineering everything is about the prompt and the llm and what you can do with it so I highly highly recommend you aim for 100 prompts every single day you can be prompting via some tool or you can raw dog it and go right in to chat GPT or right into the API these are three ways you can prepare for the 100x Improvement in state-of-the-art large language models I'm ultra excited for the release if it's not clear everything I say in my videos I am actively doing myself I have recently found a ton of value from baps I've noticed my skill as an engineer increasing because I know how to prompt faster more concisely I am starting to solve problems that I know I can use llms for and also some problems that I haven't been sure about right take a quick snapshot of this leave it on your desktop so that you just are thinking about this passively and start to employ these tactics to help you prepare for the 100x get and maintain your first mover's advantage to propel your engineering your tools and your products into the future be ready when the 100x arrives thanks so much for for watching if you enjoy this video you know what to do stay focused and keep building",
