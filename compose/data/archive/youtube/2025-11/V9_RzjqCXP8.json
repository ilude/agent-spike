  "raw_transcript": "AI coding is changing the way software is created and there's one team and one lone 20x engineer leading the way for you and I cursor is the team the cursor team has made significant strides in AI coding but there's one feature they've developed that stands far Above the Rest everything else PS in comparison in this video I'll show you what this feature is and why it's so important this feature is so new it doesn't have any real true documentation yet but if you visit the change log you can see exactly what this feature is this is none other than cursor's brand new composer feature the main trick here is that it is the new experimental multi file editing feature let's dive into it so in order to enable cursor composer feature you can go into to your settings go to the beta Flags make sure that composer is enabled here once you've done that command I will pop up a small composer window and command shift I will pop up a full screen version let's go ahead and write a change and let's convert this input and this output variable here you can see in this component let's go ahead and give this a true input field and a true output field let's open up cursor composer let's go ahead and try out the brand new chat GPT 4 latest model I'll prompt convert input into a real input field make the input dark blue and white text we'll hit enter and you can see it's focusing one file at a time right now we only have liquid prompt. viw in our context and there you can see the changes getting written I'll go ahead accept these changes you can see here we have input ping how are you it updated this to an input field and now we have a label let's go ahead and make a similar update to our output field with the difference being we want to take this output field and convert it into a markdown component that we're using in another component somewhere else so what I'll do is I'll H command in to start a new chat add another file to the context so the change I'm looking for is also in this prompt editor all I'll do is reference it and then I'll say convert output to a DC component and render The Prompt output there cool so it picked up on this component here I'll go ahead and hit accept all so we can take a look at these changes and now we're rendering this in this MDC component this is great let's go ahead and test out some of the multifile editing features that this gives us right because that's the whole point we can already do this using cursor you know we could have made all those changes using the endline selection prompt the benefit and the value of this brand new composer editor is that we can write a multiple files so what I'll say here is move the input field into its own liquid input and I'll specify the directory as well component same with the output field you can see here we're actually going to generate that component we have the liquid input liquid output and these files have now been created and now they're getting referenced right so go ahead accept all now we have this error here I'm not going to do anything manually I'm just going to highlight this I'm going to come back over to composer I'm going to paste this in resolve this error and then I'll go ahead and just add those new files right so I'll add input I'll add output and let it rip so I'm still testing out the capabilities of chat GP 40 from what I can tell it seems like a very capable model but it's not as consistent and it's not as solid as a model like Sonic 3.5 so it's going to break this model into both a value and an input that looks great I'll accept that and let's go ahead and refresh and that looks great looks like we have our rendering back up and writing there so there's an example of using cursor composer feature to write multiple components at the exact same time right so this is pretty cool to see let's go ahead and push this further I want to go ahead and improve the styling of both these components so I'm going to use cursor composers overlay feature for this so I'm going to use command shift I here so you can see we have this new composer button I'm going to go ahead and click that and start adding the context needed to make these changes so I'm going to go ahead I'm going to add the liquid prompt input and output and now we have those files in our context so now I can go ahead and just prompt whatever I'm looking for to make the changes and we can keep testing J GPT for o latest on top of composer I'm going to go ahead and add one more file here there's a reference file that I used before um that I want to go ahead and just kind of get some of the styles from so I'm going to go ahead and add prompt editor as well this is an existing code base uh let me just go ahead and show you the size here if I come in here and look for for regx um I had this before so yeah if we look at total so this code base has about 22,000 lines of code and if we do what was it grab Dash C we can see that we have about 151 files specifically TTS and view file so you know this is a fullstack code base it's a nu application this is in production this is Live code with multifile editing with these AI coding tools we're operating on about 151 across typescript and VJs and then about 22,000 lines of code so this is a small production code base there are code bases I'm sure you've seen and worked with that are much larger especially if you're mid or senior level 150 files this is fairly sizable and uh you know of course it'll continue to grow in size as the product grows but let's go ahead and hop back to our uh composer menu here looks like we lost the file references so I'm just going to add those back here we had the input output and the prompt editor and um what we're going to do here is say style the uh liquid input and liquid output to mirror The Prompt editor I'll just go ahead and leave that as it is right so we're asking the assistant to look at these four files pull these styles from the prompt editor and apply them to our liquid input and our liquid output so this is really cool you can see let me just go ahead and open this up a little bit so this is really cool right so on the right panel here you can see it walking through the changes giving an explanation and once we click the file it's going to show off the changes needed for each respective file right so this is really cool to see it's really breaking it down and showing exact changes it's making across multiple files I'll go ahead here I'll hit accept all and you can see here we have some styling so not the best styling it looks like you know it's not exactly what we were looking for but it's close enough uh remove the background from the input section and delete input colon delete the label right so just making a couple more tweaks here it's not exactly the way I want it so I'm just going to keep tweaking to get the results I'm looking for so you can see there and that iteration it only updated liquid input I'll just hit accept all and you can see in the UI it dropped that and it looks like it did drop the background on the button as well put the background back on the input HTML element okay so again I'll accept and there we go so we got the background back that looks good um now I want to Center these items it's kind of like clunky right there so and if you want to close this you just hit Escape so now you you know you're back in your regular IDE editing mode which is fantastic we can go over to the liquid prompt and now I want to give this uh something to reference by right prompt editor and then I'll just say I'll start a new chat here just because we don't need all the context I'll just go to the liquid prompt and I'll say Center the vertically and horizontally right so just go ahead prompt that let it get to work there and looks like that's good I'll go ahead and hit accept and now you can see that there it's going left to right so of course the fix for this is uh Flex call so just literally say Flex call let it make that change with the context of the previous conversation hit accept and now we have this right so you know this is just like classic styling classic CSS writing um make the width of the uh liquid input the same match the input field I'm just doing this as a test I actually don't know if this will work what I'm hoping will happen here is that it automatically adds the files uh the content inside liquid input and output to the context and makes this change so let's go ahead and just see if it it does that this is actually a test I'm not sure if this will work let's go ahead and try okay yeah so that's not working right it is only looking at the files that it has in its context and it just does that to the top level so that's fine what I'll do here is I'll hit uh reject all and then I'll add these files to the context right so this is really cool after execution I can just go ahead and add these and then I'll look for my previous message here I'll just throw this in here right so now I'm going to paste this message in again and see how it does with the context of the files so you can see now we're editing the input and the output and we also are editing the liquid prompt which I'm not sure if we need to do that let's go ahead and take a look here um input output width and we're setting that to Max with 500 pixels okay so that looks fine I'll go ahead and just accept this and now we should get some matching width roughly okay so whatever that looks fine um I'll just do one more I'll say Gap or okay Gap nine I guess I'm just doing some adding a gap here to these items and we'll just accept and there we go right so great so now we have [Music] that okay so that's good uh we're making a couple changes right this is just small you know frontend stuff but it's really nice because what we're doing here is we're kind of moving oursel up the stack we're not writing the stuff manually by hand anymore we're asking for what we want done at a higher level and then we're letting the llm we're letting our models our AI powered IDE cursor uh we're letting this stuff do the hard work for us right now we need to when we press the enter key I want whatever prompt is in here to actually execute we're going to keep these files context here on Enter key when liquid prompt run a new prompt up to liquid prompt of and run the make prompt function so long story short here is in the liquid prompt file we have this make prompt function here that is coming out of a hook and all this does is you know it runs prompt and it Returns the result right it sets it to the prompt output right here we want when we press the enter key on the input field instead of doing this in our mounted hook we want you know these components to just handle that for us so what we'll do is open this up again and we'll just let that fire so let's see how gpg 40 and composer does this for us here okay so it knows to update the input field here this is awesome it has that Enter key event set up and now it's writing that uh higher level method on the liquid prompt so uh this all looks good so I'll just hit accept all I'll say remove handle enter from unmounted so I'm just saying you know don't fire that event off on the unmounted hook we'll just do that from our mitted event so okay that looks good I'll accept close this and now we see this looking good um ping how are you I'll hit enter there it is so now it is you know giving us that content I don't know what model we're using right here so I'm just going to go ahead and just you know right a quick prompt to create an input field for that so I'll say I'll do this in a small quick composer window here so I'll just come in here um I'll hit command new and I'll just say move the model into a ref show it above the liquid input field cool so I'll accept that and close this let's go ahead and see what the model is good so we have gb4 mini running here and it's just going to show that right at the top that's fine um let's go and just take a look at what that looks like again okay that's whatever looks good and now if I hit enter here we're going to get the result results out there and type another prompt I'll say count to five okay 1 2 3 4 5 very cool count to 10 and I'll say in reverse and I'll say skip evens so you can tell this is a real llm Runing under the hood right skip three good skip n nice okay so you can tell right this is a model running under the hood that's great so let's go ahe and do a couple more things here I don't like this blue color and they the idea behind the liquid prompt editor here is that I want to show and hide this prompt editor no matter where I am we'll of course use composer for this so I'm going to switch to the liquid input file and start a new message here and the nice part about this is whatever file you have Focus it's going to automatically start the context with just that file there's the background color obviously we can tweak that update the background color and dark blue left to red right or no no no I'll say uh two top right so we'll see these changes come in here perfect and there's that gradient and okay so uh we'll allow that for now and then I want to come back in here uh just making some small tweaks just kind of moving fast doing whatever convert the model dip to a p and it should come in and just highlight this one line here great I'll accept that cool nice so now it has our font there that's awesome and now we'll we'll ask for our keyboard event so what I'll say here is using VI use slash on keystroke I think it is show and hide the liquid prompt editor div and I'll say add a ref for the show hide uh VAR okay so I'll just let that rip this is just a single file edit let's go ahead and see if it can do this I did forget to mention the exact key binding that I wanted so we'll add that up in a follow-up prompt you can see here we did get this uh solid import we got the variable we wanted and we have the keystroke which is good so that's pretty close so go ahead and accept this and then I'll go ahead and what do we get here let's go a and refresh oh so we have this bug here right so we have a full-on error so I'll say fix error bad comment line n okay good just going to go ahead and fix that for us awesome looks good default show prompt editor def false on key stroke command plus P to show and hide that VAR keep Escape as well so it shouldn't need to touch any of the other files that we have here okay nice that looks good I think this can accept a list we'll see so I'll go ahead and accept that and now it's show default false I'll hit command p and of course we're getting the classic print so I'll say I believe the Onkey stroke uh yeah put places the event here right so event and then we have the keyboard event and then we have to you know do that manually so I'll just use cursor tab here to do these Auto completions another incredible feature from the cursor team but so let's go ahead and try this now right all right so it looks like these key combinations aren't working with on keystroke they're just not supported like this it only handles the individual button presses that's fine what'll I'll do here is I'll come in and I'll just add show and hide this right it's actually faster so that's good now we're showing and hiding that now we have this small super simple prompt editor that we can you know ideally we can you know convert portion into its own component and then just kind of place wherever we want to right so let's move this content and the relevant scripting into its own components so just like we did for liquid input and output let's go ahead and just move you know all this content here into its own component um I'm going to use the larger editor for this and start a new composer and all I'll do is load the liquid prompt move the and what do we call this liquid prompt editor uh move the liquid prompt editor and all related State into its own component and we'll say call it liquid prompt editor. view okay so now we're going to ask for all of it to be moved into its own component it's going to do all the importing it needs and then it's going to also update the top level uh liquid prompt just as before it looks like it is going to miss the on keystroke event so I'll say don't forget to move the on keystroke into the component and I'll send that as a followup perfect and then all we're left with here in the previous component is just the top level items that we had before a couple unused variables couple hooks whatever so I'll go ahead accept all changes you can see we have the first change here this is the brand new liquid prompt editor file it created this entire file for us and then we have the previous liquid prompt. viw file which just has you know a couple additional uh components and the editor itself so I'll accept Okay so looks like we have an error that's totally fine again I'm just going to copy all this we have an unknown keywords open up compos again going to start a new window I'm going to add our new file here and I'll say resolve this issue okay so just got this unnecessary variable here I'll I'll just say just remove unsub okay so that looks good let's make sure liquid prompt changes are also looking good uh we don't need this composable here at all drop the use prompt editor import next part about no this is automatically imported for us so just going to ask it to drop that for us uh no need for that okay now it's trying to delete other code so it thinks I wanted to remove all of it it's kind of being too smart in a way so this could be easily solved with a system prompt where I say hey we're using n um in N we automatically have all of our Hooks and our components imported we also don't need any view Imports you can do that through the system prompt message in the cursor settings I'm just going to ask it to undo these changes so undo uh just don't import keep the handle enter functionality the same okay so this is fine I'm going to hit accept all and then I'm just going to drop this change back in so that it has that and let's go ahead and make sure it all still works great so this is pretty cool right so a couple bumps a couple hiccups I personally am still trying to figure out exactly uh where the capabilities of composer are but also you know every model that you use here operates differently if you're using AER or continue or any other type of AI coding tool you really have to see and kind of play with how the model performs every model performs different with every different tool remember that the engineers the people building out these tools they are writing prompts and prompt has a different impact and every prompt has a different impact with different models chbt 40 is super new super bleeding edge I'm going to say you know keep using claw 3.5 Sonet for coding with some of these modelss you can't really just look at the benchmarks and know how it will perform um I can tell you and I've been saying this for a while and if you're actually writing code with AI you know this as well claw 3.5 Sonet is the king of AI coding and it integrates the best with coding tools just trying out gpg 40 here I can tell you that uh Sonet wouldn't have made some of the mistakes that cat gbt 40 made and that has nothing to do with the composer feature from the cursor team so this is really cool right with this brand new composer feature we now have multifile editing inside of the cursor IDE with it we were able to fairly quickly build out a simple prompt editing tool if you want the insane productivity gains that are available to you you need to be using the incredible AI coding tools that unlock these capabilities for you right so we're talking about cursor and we're talking about AER these are the two AI coding tools leading the way writing code is cheaper and faster than ever I am just getting started using this composer feature I I discovered it this past week and I've been really digging in honestly before this feature I was moving more and more away from cursor uh multifile editing is a massive killer feature for AI coding it allows you to write code like you actually do which is across you know 5 10 sometimes 20 files at the same time so this is really powerful especially for the you know mid senior level Engineers that are making changes across large code bases this is a smaller code base only you know 150 files but this is a tool that you can use on real production code bases cursor's new composer feature really allows you to unlock multifile editing which is like I mentioned a massive massive must for writing code on production code bases as large lingers models improve and we get Claude 3.5 Opus we get GPT NEX we get strawberry we get Gemini 1.5 Ultra you'll be able to lean more and more into these multifile editing capabilities big shout out to the cursor team you guys are doing great work um and you know at the beginning I mentioned the lone 20x engineer that is none other than Paul working on AER I recommend both these tools for AI coding since the beginning these two tools have been my favorite uh Paul is building AER and the cursor team is building cursor of course these are my recommendations for AI coding as many AI coding tools as I've tried I keep coming back to these two and I keep sharing these two on the channel for good reason they're the best two tools you can use to multiply your output as an engineer these tools are also really important and Powerful because they're focusing on the experience of the engineer they're focusing on what it's actually like to be in a code base with hundreds and hundreds and thousands of files with hundreds of thousands of lines of code both AER and cursor are the products that understand that and they're building out the experience for us Engineers big shout out to both of them I'm going to be covering both these tools more on the channel as I have for the past year or so I'll link a couple of the previous videos if you're super amped on AI coding those will be in the description for you you can check those out I hope this demo of cursor new composer feature was helpful for you if it was you know what to do drop the like drop the sub leave a comment let me know how your AI coding is going let me know how much you're using these tools big thanks and I'll see you in the next one for",
