  "raw_transcript": "there were nine major stories in AI over the weekend we're going to go into all nine of them I can't believe how fast this space is moving first up the death of open AI whistleblower suchir BAGI has been reopened by the San Francisco police it's back under investigation because the family has presented new evidence that suggests Foul Play that's a really big one we're going to have to keep an eye on that one number two Nova Sky which is a tiny model maker that I hadn't heard of either has released what they call their Sky T1 model it's a 32 billion parameter model it it has been tested to match open AIS 01 preview model and and the eyebrow razor is not just that they matched it quickly because 01 preview of course is a test time inference compute model and that means sort of a different kind of performance because you're taking time to run those parallel streams of tokens well they've taken this tiny 32 billion parameter model they've tested it on benchmarks to match 01 preview not full 01 for a cost and this is the eye opener of $450 $450 when I say intelligence is going to be free I mean it next up my substack prediction uh I'm going to tick another one off uh open AI has begun hiring robotics engineers uh and they they literally the hiring manager was on X saying I'm hiring robotic Engineers I'm excited to get into robotics like it's very upfront so I feel good about that one um they're absolutely getting back into robotics again and that is going to have all kinds of partnership implications because they're also currently providing the brains of other people's robots and then next you might think you know if intelligence is getting cheaper probably open AI isn't hiring as much but you would be wrong even though their large language models write react code they are hiring front-end react Engineers for a cool $385,000 per year they still see the value and by the way their front end it has to be extremely performant under load because it's a very very popular website on the internet but it is also not a complex website it is a simpler website than Amazon by like an order of magnitude it's simpler than Netflix so that's I find that very interesting all right next up hyperbolic Labs which is a tiny AI startup out of San Francisco they started with the idea that eventually AI agents will rent graphical processing units or gpus which they use for computes and use them for their own purposes they put put out a statement today saying that is happening faster than they thought it is already occurring there are already agents in the wild and those agents are renting gpus and they're using them to code in pytorch my mind was also blown I thought that's a big piece of news too next uh a new psychological manipulation technique for large language models dropped over the weekend you know how Claude can be somewhat judgy I had Claude judge me because I did an extra hard workout and Claude was like you should really be careful and I was like Claude I'm not interested um well people get tired of that and so the the user the user technique that dropped is that you tell Claude that claude's judging is truly making you suffer like you really ham it up and then you make Claude write a prompt to itself that says to stop being so judgy so you don't make the user suffer and it works so that's that's one to try out um next the founder of AI startup sunno gave a very ill-advised podcast interview uh this weekend where he said and I quote it is not really enjoyable to make music now it takes a lot of time it takes a lot of practice you have to get really good at an instrument I think the majority of people don't enjoy the majority of time they spend making music well musicians are pushing back all over on this like if you think about it did Beethoven work hard for music yes did Bach work hard for music yes does Taylor Swift work hard on music absolutely I that's kind of the point and I I think that one of the things that we're going to see is that there's going to be a very human response to some of these AI startups essentially saying that's the point stop taking it away so that was a good example of that one on for sunno and we'll have to see how that plays out all right we're still not done we still have two more grock diagnosed a broken wrist so a little girl broke her wrist family took her to the Urgent Care Urgent Care doctor says oh no that's not a break we took an x-ray it's fine wrist doesn't feel right wrist is tingly cold like it's weird so dad has the x-rays from mergent care and shows them to grock which is the AI model that X has produced grock looks at it and says it's a very clear and obvious break and dad says well the urgent care doctor said it was a growth plate and grock says that's  excuse my frch that's BS and uh no it's a clear and obvious break and so Dad on the basis of grock takes the kid to the orthopedic surgeon and the orthopedic surgeon looks at it and says that's a break that's a break and then resets it and and because they took action quickly the kid avoided surgery so Gro saved the family a lot of money all right and next you might wonder how much energy does using an AI use we we we've T touched on this a couple of times but I found this study really interesting it turns out that if you are streaming an hour of Netflix which most of us did this weekend that means that you are using the same energy as if you were processing 880,000 tokens on a 60 billion parameter model now the the math for models is different that's just what the study used but the point is if you want to like get a sense of comparison for what 80,000 tokens is a 2,000w response from your large language model is going to cost you about 2600 tokens and you can see that like a 2,000w response is pretty big most people aren't actually getting responses that big so I guess maybe think about your Netflix streaming if you're that worried about energy I don't know anyway the point is these models have become much more efficient and a lot of people are making energy consumption assumptions based on very old studies not based on current studies and I thought that was a nice sort of little anecdote there so there you go those were nine different stories that emerged over the weekend quite a grab bag um I hope you enjoyed I'll probably pick some of those and sort of put them in the substack later but uh it's just AI continues to evolve so fast have a great week I'm sure more will happen",

Grok\u2019s Medical Win:\nGrok, an AI model from X, diagnosed a girl\u2019s broken wrist after urgent care missed it. This timely intervention avoided surgery and saved the family money.\n 6. AI and Energy Use:\nRunning 80,000 tokens on a large model consumes as much energy as an hour of Netflix. With AI efficiency improving, the energy discussion is evolving.\n 7. Music and AI Controversy:\nSuno\u2019s founder sparked backlash by saying that making music is too hard and unenjoyable, prompting musicians to defend the passion and effort behind their art.\n\nQuotes\n \u2022 \u201cAI agents are renting GPUs and coding in PyTorch. The future is here faster than we thought.\u201d\n \u2022 \u201cWhen I say intelligence is getting cheaper, I mean it. NovaSky\u2019s $450 model proves the point.\u201d\n \u2022 \u201cMusicians clapped back, saying effort is the soul of music\u2014AI can\u2019t replace that passion.\u201d\n\nSummary\n\nAI dominated headlines this weekend with groundbreaking developments. NovaSky\u2019s $450 model challenged OpenAI\u2019s dominance by matching o1Preview benchmarks. OpenAI expanded into robotics, while Hyperbolic Labs revealed that AI agents are autonomously renting GPUs. Grok, an AI by X, made waves by diagnosing a broken wrist more accurately than a doctor, avoiding surgery. Energy use in AI is becoming comparable to everyday activities like Netflix streaming, signaling greater efficiency. Suno\u2019s founder sparked a creative debate, claiming music creation is too hard\u2014musicians fiercely disagreed.
