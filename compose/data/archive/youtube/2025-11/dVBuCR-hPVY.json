  "raw_transcript": "subcoders so you clicked on this video you want to build software on your own terms you want to serve your community you want to build viable products and you want to make money while doing it fantastic that's awesome welcome you came to the right place today we're talking about an indie Hacker's most important resource this is going to apply to anyone that's building their own business because it's such an important fundamental topic today we're going to talk about Runway and strategies to manage build and consume your Runway first things first today we're going to be using this program called mermaid it's a really cool visual editor you can create flow charts and different types of diagrams link will be in the description for this awesome resource definitely check it out so we're going to go over the strategies for Indie hackers to build and manage their Runway first we need to take a step back and answer the question what is Runway All right so couple terms to knock out here what is Runway right so time you have left to build your product given your Capital right we'll just say capital is just a fancy way of saying cash basically so time you have left to build your product given your cash right so let's let's walk through a simple example quickly so you know let's say you have 10K 10K in the bank right you spend 2K a month right so if we take that and subtract 2K so per month you're going to be left with five months you'll have zero alright so this is a super super minimal example right we're assuming here that you're not working we're assuming that you spend 2K a month we're assuming that uh you only have 10K in the bank all right really simple example but this is what Runway is right it's the time you have left until you're out of cash and specifically when we're talking about building products and when we're talking about building our business this is the time you have left to build your business given how much cash you have left in the bank all right so let's dial in just a little bit more I want to talk about this 2K value right so this 2K is what's called our burn okay so this 2K value is our burn so this is the amount of cash we spend per period of time usually per month in this example of 10K in the bank right the burn is our 2K a month however much we spend per period all right and then one more term before we jump into things time to build so time to build is the amount of time you have to build given your schedule so this is a term I just kind of like made up but it's super important right so um as solopreneurs Indie hackers uh whatever schedule you have right like we some of us are working some of us are doing contract works part-time work some of us are taking many retirements to build our software like whatever that is time to build is really important because each one of the strategies we're going to talk about is going to have different amounts of time to build and that's really important because the more time to build you have the faster you can iterate and build your product okay so just some simple terms here now that we're all on the same page let's jump into the strategies okay so this is what this video is all about we're talking about strategies to help you manage your Runway right not only manage your Runway but consume it also so let's just jump right into this we're going to start at the top I have you know uh six or seven different strategies here don't worry this is not going to take a ton of time we're just going to talk about the high level and you can take these and run with it and think about using and consuming your runway in a better more concrete way that's the whole point of this video so first things first we have to get the kind of stupid example out the way YOLO right so what is YOLO so YOLO is have tons of cash already build your product and then you're just gonna repeat this right so like this is super simple all right so YOLO is just you already have cash right you have tons of money saved up maybe you're you have Rich parents and they don't care what you do like whatever your situation is I'm not here to judge you I'm just saying this is one strategy right if you have a bunch of cash already just build your product your burn probably doesn't matter if you have 500k in the bank most of us are not in this Camp right so let's come back down to earth a little bit let's talk about another strategy so you know let me just quickly add this to our chart okay so let's talk about the strategy go negative okay so this is uh not the best strategy um what exactly is go negative go negative you're going to um get debt via credit card or loan build your product work pay off that okay so not not really a recommended strategy um and then you're going to repeat um not a huge fan of this guys don't go in the debt like you're not a business you're not a big freaking startup like don't risk doing this I'm just gonna say that right away this is not a great strategy we're kind of going from least legit to most legit here uh probably could have picked better ordering for this video but who cares next we're talking about all in all out so now we're getting to the more concrete strategies okay so what is all in all out in the All In All Out strategy what you're going to do is you're going to work full time build Runway right so you're going to save cash essentially quit when the time is right I'm not just saying randomly quit your job right quit where the time is right then you're going to uh build right and then you're going to repeat right so we're going to go back to uh let's see here right so fantastic so this is the All In All Out strategy right you're going to take a prolonged period of time where you're working and then you're going to build up your Runway you're going to save cash and then you're going to quit at some point and just full time focus on building right all in all out really clean really simple as I'm as I'm walking through these examples you can kind of like see the cycle here right everything works in this cycle you're going to flow through a series of things throughout a prolonged period of time maybe this is months maybe this is years but it's all about finding time to build right ttb you want to manage your Runway and your burned so that you have the most time to build that's kind of what all these strategies are about right while maintaining and living your life and of course paying the bills like you know being an indie hacker solopreneur micropreneur you have to manage your Runway um I just I feel like that's kind of like the core of this video and you know just to kind of put it in more concrete terms and talk about some strategies I think is super helpful um certainly has been for me because you know over the you know past year or so I've just tried a lot of these strategies and uh and it's been super helpful so that's why I'm making this video hopefully it's helpful for you guys let's let's keep going all right so half and half uh what is half and half so in the half and half strategy what you're doing here is you're going to be so you're going to be working uh part-time and building okay the nice part about this strategy is that that's kind of it uh you know like if you can work a part-time job at low lower your burn um you know maybe maybe I'll throw that in here um I'll throw that in here first right just so that it's super clear that you have to have low burn lower your burn you know slash expenses that's what burn really is right it's uh expenses given a period of time we'll do the loop there right okay so really cool all right so lower your burn slash expenses work part-time um and build right so this is a really fantastic strategy because you can basically just do this in quotes forever uh for a long period of time as long as you're you lower your burn that's the trick here you can't be living this extravagant life you can't be you know in a nice you know cushy apartment or condo or whatever like all right so next strategy let's talk about Contract Killer right so this is this is a pretty I think it's a pretty clean strategy um for managing your Runway so you're going to pick up contract work build Runway finish contract then we're going to build and then we're going to repeat right so ee right so pretty clean strategy also and the contract killer Runway strategy you pick up contract work you build your Runway you finish your work then you're going to go into a building cycle right build your products and then you know once you run out of cash but once you run low enough you're going to cycle back and you're going to pick up some more contract work so this is pretty cool um another fantastic strategy it's it's stable it can work there's going to be a little more pressure and stress just because you're going to be picking up work and you're going to need to be managing and thinking ahead about okay where's my next contract and during your off time when you're doing contract work you'll you'll definitely be developing ideas for your product next I want to talk about the most important strategy of all possibly do it all okay so let's take this into an individual chart here what does do it all mean right so this this is my current strategy right now so you're going to work full time and build and that's basically it honestly that's basically it you're gonna work full time and build okay the biggest problem with this strategy is that your time to build ttb is super low out of all these strategies this is probably the the harshest on your time to build right on the flip side it's the most stable right so you could do this for the longest period of time with the lowest stress but you're also at the same time going to be making the least progress out of all these strategies building your business as a solopreneur Indie hacker micropreneur you know this is where I'm at right now I've done Contract Killer strategy I've done um I haven't done half and half I would definitely like to try that I've definitely done all in all out don't do go negative all right so we have one last strategy Here Right End Game I feel like you guys probably assume what this is this is where you want it all to end okay in the end game strategy do any strategy make your product profitable lower your burn below your profit and build [Music] scale grow forever [Music] right this is the end game once you have a profitable business you have made it right that's the end game strategy that's what we're all trying to do we're all trying to build the product we're all trying to build our community and serve our community and um you know it it makes me super happy thinking about being here one day and you know part of the reason I am even doing this channel is to document my journey trying to get to the end game I feel like it would be so cool to watch someone build from nothing you know from being like a full-time employee engineer to going through all the trials and all the problems and all the things that are involved in building a sustainable software business and a small one at the same time right um so anyway I say all that because that's what this channel is about that's what my journey is about right now really that's what my life is about like I want to get to the point where I'm running this end game strategy and I feel like you guys want that to keep it small keep it simple keep it sustainable you know just pay the bills get your time back right that's the most important thing here um if you want to get your time back so anyway uh talked a lot during this video I hope you guys enjoyed this um I'm gonna go ahead and post this chart and you know I'll probably use it in a thumbnail or something but um yeah that's basically it so these are all the kind of high level strategies I hope this has helped you guys and wherever you're at whatever strategy you're working on whatever strategy you're using you know I think it's really important to be aware and conscious of the different ways that you can move through managing your cash your capital and creating time for you to really dig in and build your product at the end of the day we all have bills to pay even if you're you know still in school like one day you're gonna graduate and you're going to be in the real world where you have bills and whatnot so you know these strategies can and will be really important for you to think about and really internalize so that you can manage your Runway keep your burn low and increase your time to build to as much as you can so that you can reach the end game strategy right that's what this is all about guys you can check out this diagram in the description wherever you are whatever you're doing keep building keep pushing yourself let's keep building great software and experiences and I'll see you guys in the next one [Music]",
