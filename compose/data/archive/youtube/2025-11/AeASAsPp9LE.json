  "raw_transcript": "are you an engineer that understands the value of testing your code but you don't want to spend the extra one two three four five hours it takes to write debug and validate your tests well I think testing is solved and I know that's a really bold statement but with this tool you can do five percent of the work and get eighty percent of your tests written in this video I want to show you a brand new way to write your tests using GPT powered AI coding assistant ader we're gonna hand off the process of writing our tests to an AI coding assistant if you haven't heard of ader definitely check out my previous AI coding videos where I walk through installing ader from scratch and use it to generate front-end components I'll link that in the description I'm a small Niche engineering Channel and those videos completely blew up huge shout out to everyone who liked sub and got value out of those videos enough how type talk let me show you this is real so here's a simple python application that reads and writes to a notion page and notion database there are three python files we're going to be operating on Main notion and notion test in Maine we've set up some notion tokens pages and database IDs we've imported some functions all we're doing here is writing text to a notion page reading texts will read from the database on the notion page and then we'll convert that database as rows into simple Json format here's the notion page and here's the notion database if we go ahead open up our terminal start our environment and run python on Main we hop back over we now have a Hello World block and our notion page if we hop over to our notion.ui file these are the supporting functions that we use in main.py the details of the functions we don't need to go into too much you can see here we have right text where we write text to a notion page we have right dick to files we have read text we have this safe nested property getter this basically just allows us to fetch nested content out of Json and then we have a medium-sized function where we read the rows from notion and then we pull out the properties one by one using the save git method here so you have your code you're ready to go and then you realize there are no tests for this module this file has no tests now I have to write another test Suite by hand well not anymore let's crack open the terminal export your openai API key and then type ader using the gpt4 model all right let's add our notion and notion test file and now let's have a natural language to tell aider exactly how to test our notion python file using pod test right tests test.py the cover function in mock the notion client variable use the patch function to patch methods on the notion client and let's go ahead and run so as you can see here ater tells you exactly what it needs to do it is actively writing those tests it's writing the patch just like I said it's using the mock version of the notion client just like I mentioned and there it is it's testing the save get method amazing okay first things first before we even look at the tests let's just run Pi test and see how ader has done okay so we have about four failed tests and one pass normally we would you know start digging in figure out what's going on with our tests but I'm not going to do any of that what I'm going to do is hop back over to ader I'm going to type slash run and then I'm going to type Pi test and what this command will do is run Pi tests and feed the output of Pi test back into ader all right so that's going to append the output directly to Ada let's go ahead and let that run let's see how it does let's run podcast again go stop for errors let's just go ahead and repeat let's see if hater can handle these errors all right let's run again okay awesome so this time we got one filled four pass so it seems like with the output of the error messages from PI test Ada was able to self-correct itself and now we just have one error left it looks like we're trying to mock Python's built-in open method for file writing so what I'm going to do here is just let ader fully write and read from a file to confirm this test so let's go ahead and write that update the predict to file write and read from disk don't Mark anything okay looks like we've got a an error here um this is definitely something I want it to happen so we could walk through this I got a token usage error all the GPT models have Windows right it can't hold that much information so if we go ahead and type slash tokens went over this in previous editor videos as you can see here our total tokens are over the max window so we need to go ahead and clear our chat history or type slash clear slash tokens and you can see we dropped back to 2000 tokens so we have 5 000 remaining now let's reset and we have some additional context window for memory let's go ahead and type up a couple times and rerun that modification to our test there's the original where we're trying to mock the built-in open function and here's a new version where we just go ahead write read and call it a day awesome so looks like it needs a Json import I'm going to go ahead and just add this no big deal let's go ahead and run our tests now we have a fully passing test Suite that tests all the functionality in our module so you know a couple things to note here five functions it's about 100 lines long it's not super complex we did run into a couple issues and we needed to work with ader to get those issues solved but in reality solving the issue was as simple as running Ron Pi test and basically just feeding the output from PI test back into ader so that it could self-correct so this is pretty incredible right we have five tests written and all we did was import Json you can start to see how useful this can be when it comes to setting up just getting some tests out getting some scaffolding done all by typing and natural language so these tests would be acceptable in some engineering orgs or if you're a solo Premier Dev running your own biz you've just generated probably 60 or 70 of the value a test can offer just by having some type of tests in place but let's push ader to do more for us here let's see if we can add tests parameterization to better cover test cases let's go ahead and open up ader and let's type where it makes sense ADD test monitorization existing tests increase that's coverage all right so let's see how it does right now it's describing the change it's gonna make it's gonna again give us the original and then it's going to give us hopefully all of our tests working with test parameterization and just to quickly say test parameterization is a kind of pseudo-automated way to pass in multiple variables into your tests as lists so that I can run different versions of your test let me know if you're interested in a video on Pi testing I can definitely dive more into that okay so it looks like that finished let's take a look at what that looks like if we collapse everything when it made sense ader added parameterization to some of our tests so in a right test function now this test will run twice and pass in the text and type and two iterations of the test we also have a updated test for our DOT chain git function as you can see here it locked out three versions of a Json object and then it tried to fetch different content within the Json object using the dot pattern and here it's looking for specific values so let's go ahead run Pi test and see what we get awesome we set up tests from nothing we had a couple errors we fed them back into ader it fixed them and then we made a tweak to one test that was failing in a particularly unique way using the built-in open function and then we added parameterization with zero errors now there's one more test that I want to give a little more attention you can see our read table into rows function is only asserting that it was called with a specific set of variables this doesn't actually test the underlying functionality at all so let's go ahead and look at this function and dig into how we could ask Eder to better test this method so what I'm going to do here is type exactly how I want to rewrite that test update to have client.databases.query return an object structure that can be used for the safe get methods to fully test the function we want Editor to mock out this function call with some solid results where we can actually test our said get function and have an array of these Json objects returned let's see how it does we're really putting aider to the test now here's the updated version where it's mocking out the full results this is incredible there's a new expected result okay so that's completed let's check out that test so as you can see we have that mock return value and now we're setting up client databases query return value to give us back our mocked value so we're going to have a better representation of what this test actually covers if we run Pi test awesome ader does it again this is fantastic technology I estimate this cut the time it took to test in half that's roughly a 50 gain in productivity now it's not all roses here it doesn't nail the test perfectly but gets pretty close and solves the you know kind of a cold start problem of having to set up and get the first iteration down the second possible issue is that you're going to have to pay more attention to your token usage as it can run a bill if you add too many files and if each file is above you know 300 lines or more I would quickly encounter the whole token usage pricing deal by just asking a simple question like how much is your time worth for me especially when it comes to writing tests I'd rather pay a little bit to accelerate the testing process so I can focus on core parts of the test and focus more on writing my code I recommend you try this on a smaller project you're working on or a bigger project but only add a couple files if you're interested in learning the notion API I created a series of tutorials on that where we cover authentication writing reading and then database writing and reading as well definitely give eight or a shot see if it's another tool you can add to your toolbox I also just want to quickly note that I use podcasts in this video you can use just you can use five tests wherever you are on the stack Ada is powered by GPT three four and whatever's coming next so it's fully aware of whatever was built up to September 2021st with blasted past 500 subs and we're well on our way to ending our goal of 1K Subs by the end of the month huge thanks I really appreciate all the support I've been grinding sharing my unique take on ai ai power tools all I want to do here is help you become a better engineer by utilizing the best latest and greatest tools available huge thanks for watching sub like and I'll see you in the next video",
