  "raw_transcript": "in this video you'll learn how to build python packages and deploy them so that you can install from pip anywhere anytime we'll also walk through techniques to accelerate your ability to learn new tech and build poc's or proof of Concepts using modern AI tools we're going to be publishing to the test python packaging index we're going to be using poetry as our packaging and dependency management solution we're going to use AER pair programming in your terminal to stream the process of writing and testing and then we're going to be using chat gbt with gb4 to help us Fast Track our information retrieval process and help us walk through step by step how to get things set up in a quick seamless manner so first things first we're using poetry so go ahead get poetry installed and once you're ready to go open your terminal and type poetry version to make sure you have it installed then type poetry new I'm going to call this first python pack with AI cool so created that package inside the directory so if we just go in there open up vs code it created our core application and then it created a Pi Project tomel file so this is the file we're going to be largely operating in this is going to detail how we'll publish our package and how our dependencies are built up for this project so first things first we're just going to come into our application create a main and just generate a basic main function and there we go so just a basic hello world all right so let's test if you haven't used poetry before basically we're going to run poetry shell is going to activate our shell and I'm going to use the VM to run our main file awesome so that's working there without looking at any of the documentation we just want to ask GPT how do we get a basic example setup where we can use poetry to deploy our package so I'm going to say how can we use poetry a package to test it's walking through the setup installation exactly like I said we're going to do going to add poetry and then you're going to create a new poetry directory and then we're going to type poetry build so I'm going to go ahead and do that here so poetry build awesome so you can see we have a brand new disc folder that has the wheel and the S dist or the source distribution of our python package okay all right awesome so now it looks like it wants us to publish to test piie if you haven't go ahead and get set up with test piie go ahead and log in here so it want us to configure the repository URL to use the test python packaging domain and then it want us to set up a token so I'm going to go ahead and just copy this and hop over to my terminal paste this in so that we can figure to publish our package to test pie instead of the default python packaging system so going to go ahead and do that and then if you type po Tre config list you can see all of your configuration options all right so now I'm going to grab my token so I can set this variable up in the configuration if you go to set settings and you scroll down to grab a token I'm going to hit add API token and call it test token and I'm going to give it access to all projects once you have that go ahead drop your token in replace this your token variable and then I'm going to publish using the test piy repository parameter so I'm just going to copy this awesome so that uploaded you should see a brand new project so you can see here my first python pack with AI just like we described and now we can manage and view so if we hit view we can copy this snippet where we want to install so we have this we could now install this into a python package somewhere and consume the code what I want to do is configure this so that we run our application as a global command line tool I'm going to hop back over to GPT and ask how do I publish this package as a global C tool all right so fantastic so gpg has given us another set of instructions here to run so I'm going to do something a little different here I'm going to boot up AER our AI pair programming assistant I've created videos on this in the past definitely feel free to check those out but we're going to start AER and we're going to hand AER these instructions and we want it to run and update everything it needs to we'll take the output from chat GPT and we'll feed it right into a and let AER make the updates to our program we'll copy chat gpts output we'll open up vs code right at the top here I'm going to drop in guide. txt we're going to paste in chat gpt's output I'm going to boot up AER by exporting my open AI key and then I'm going to type ader so now I'm going to add a couple of files so that AER has context of them I'm going to type add we're going to add the guide. txt P project. toml this is our configuration file and then we're going to add first p compack with AI SL main.py we're going to add all those files and then we're going to ask AER follow the instructions in guide to convert our python app into a CLI app we can deploy with poetry use our main.py file awesome so you can see it made that change to the main file and now it's going into our project. tomble file and it's going to update it to make the change it needs to deploy this application as a CLI app there we go and you can see in the tool. poetry. scripts header it is specifying our entry point for the application so this is not a huge change but the cool part about this is that the change happened to all of our files automatically all we did was dump a bunch of content from chat gbt into a text file for AER to read so we have this really cool cycle of GPT generating instructions and we feed it to AIP programmer AER to then run the instructions to help us learn and prototype faster so let's just do a quick smoke test let's rerun our application make sure it still works and we're just going to type first Main and so we can see that that's still running we have this separate build and publish step I want to see if there's a way to both publish and build in a single step so that we don't have to think about it so let's see let's just ask gbt can I build and publish in the same step cool so we can see there's a way to both build and publish I'm just going to go ahead and copy this this will build publish and then send it to uh the test python packaging run that here it looks like I am uploading I'm uploading a package it already exists if we open the help here in test Pi this is because we already have this version number so when you're working in building your package you're going to need to bump up your version number and as you can see here in your P project. toml file there is a version number so I'm just going to go ahead and bump this up one and then rerun our publish package that worked perfectly so if I hop back over to our package on tespy we have the new updated version so this is fantastic so now I can actually just install this let's see what happens I'm going to open up up a terminal I'm going to copy our installation commands then I'm going to say pip install with the Das if flag this is specifying the package management system that we're using we're using test py so we need that - I flag and then we're specifying the name of our python package so I'm going to go ahead and hit enter here awesome so it installed so since we had AER and GPT update our pip project and Tomo file all we have to do is type the name of our package and we can let's let's get to a fresh directory so there's no local anything happening type the name of our package hit enter and you can see we have the output from our program running in our terminal we've just deployed a python package to test p and we can now use this anywhere anytime in any environment and it's shared across the web so anyone that wants to use this can so after you've tested you've made modifications to your application and you want to deploy to the actual production environment of the package ecosystem all you're going to do is you're going to go to the actual p.org domain and you're going to hit login and register it's going to be basically the exact same process when you're walking through these steps you can ignore setting up a remote repository so you'll just type these commands without setting up the references to test piie if you're unsure if you're running into issues you can just go ahead and ask GPT how do I deploy to to the production public domain fantastic okay and as you can see it's basically as I said you're going to update your piie token to be your actual production API token and then you're going to type publish without the repository flag and then once you're ready you can just install as you did previously that's a basic guide on how to use poetry to set up your first python package after it's all said and done you're going to have a python package that you can run anywhere in any environment on any device and and of course share it with the entire world let's go ahead and make one more tweak I want to add a command line flag that will change how our program behaves this is very common when you're building CLI applications you're going to want to pass in some flags that alter the behavior of your application what I'm going to do is ask AER to modify our main program to accept a couple of command line parameters and it will redeploy using poetry publish update our mup UF file to include two CLI parameters the first parameter flag one will change the print message the second parameter a custom message use arar so with AER if you made a modification that hasn't been committed It'll ask if you want to commit it I'm going to go ahead and say yes and I'm going to rerun awesome so so as you can see AER updated our program we're going to use AR par that's just passing in an arbitrary flag called flag one and if it's true it's just going to say the flag one was used and we also pass in a second progam called message which is going to be a type string and if it's there we're also going to print out whatever that message was I'll remove this else statement here I don't need any logic I'll just always print hello from the CLI but if we have these flags they will just go ahead and print let's go ahead and run our python on our main file and we'll just print it by itself first great then we're going to go ahead and add flag one flag one was used here and then on top of that we're going to go ahead and add flag one and-- message here is a custom message awesome so you can see flag ones if statement was activated custom message if statement was activated and we got hello from the CLI all right so I'm going to go ahead and just manually bump this version up to 0.1.2 and then we're just going to go ahead and run poetry publish still targeting the test python environment so I'm just going to do that hit enter and it's going to go and upload that fantastic we can hop over to test pie and see if we refresh we're going to see we're at version 0.1.2 just like we specified and if I reinstall this in the terminal now I'm going to reinstall the latest version of our python package here when you're updating existing python packages you're going to want to install with the D- upgrade flag and so you can see it picked up the latest version now if we go ahead and now if we go ahead and run our python CLI application we get hello from the CLI as expected but now we have access to these two new Flags so now if I type-- flag one you can see that the new version was updated it was published and we're getting that new functionality and just like the test from before we'll go ahead and type-- message this is awesome help us learn and deploy our first python package so you can see that printed there and there and there publishing your own package is really cool you get to put your work out there you get to enable other Engineers to work faster to work better I've been wanting to learn this for a while and the fact that we could use AI tools like chat gbt to walk us through the entire process and then take some of the output from from chat GPT and feed it into AER or other programming tools like GPT engineer Auto GPT uh or gorilla GPT there are so many tools now that you can use to accelerate both your learning rate and to help you prototype your applications from the ground up on this channel as you guys know I want to help you become a better programmer and engineer by sharing the latest and greatest useful engineering tools and Technology right now the wave is AI whatever will be in the future I'll be there covering it getting value out of it and sharing what I'm learning with you on this channel if you end up walking through this and you know creating your own package comment share it in the description or if you've already created your own package I'd love to see what you've made I have a useful idea I want to build out and in upcoming videos you'll be able to watch me from scratch based on what we've learned here build out a python package and deploy it from zero to published I appreciate you watching I'll see you in the next one",
