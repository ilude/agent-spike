  "raw_transcript": "industry disruption is a tale as old as time once there are two owners of delivery services that used horses to transport Goods the first John had been in the business for over a decade and he knew the ins and outs of horse-drawn carriages as an expert he was reluctant to change his ways as automobiles began to emerge the second business owner Sarah saw the potential and the new technology and decided to invest in automobiles for her business you already know where this is going as time went on Sarah's business grew rapidly while John's declined customers were drawn to the speed and efficiency of Sarah's automobile deliveries Sarah was able to transport more Goods in less time she was able to do more with less while John's business declined and eventually he had to close shop it also became more difficult for John to find work his knowledge of horse on carriages became obsolete this deceptively simple story has three Timeless principles hidden within it and this video will parallel the automobile Revolution to the AI Revolution that's happening right now as you're watching this video as I'm filming this video we'll discuss these three Timeless principles that you can use to filter out the noise and the signal in the AI Revolution my name is Dan I have a decades worth of software engineering experience I'm currently working full-time at an artificial intelligence startup working in the real estate space when I'm not working on that startup I'm working to build my own I spend almost all my free time Indie hacking and building software right now I'm in the process of becoming Sarah I've just finished building a gbt powered notion Auto tweeting application this application automatically generates and sends tweets all I do is curate the tweets by rejecting or approving them I built this in less than eight hours total and I built the whole thing here on YouTube in public feel free to check out those videos if you're interested to see what you can do with the new AI technology that's coming out now these three principles is what helped me to learn build and share these new AI Technologies if you use these principles the right way they'll point you to what you should be focusing on and what you should be ignoring with the rise of AI generated content we're going to see a lot of noise so being principled is key we're on in not out this is a fire sale not a fire disruption favors flexible fast-moving Risk Takers Sarah took a risk in adopting this new technology that risk and the flexibility of her business is what led to the positive upside she received by joining the automobile Revolution early to succeed with AI you need to be running into these Technologies if you've clicked on this video you've already heard them all chai GPT llama gbt3 gbt4 chat gbt plugins barred freaking Bing Dolly mid-journey the list goes on and on and on I want you to imagine this right now you don't want to be the guy in the forest cutting down trees to build this home with an ax while everyone around you is using chainsaws that brings us to principle two more with less Sarah was able to do more by adopting the new technologies available to her quickly the speed in which you adopt these new technologies will elongate the gap between you and the time it takes for everyone else to catch up when you adopt matters if you spot a tool or technology that allows you to do more with less allows you to create more with less time allows you to generate more output with less input you found a lever when you activate this lever it gives you more than the guy standing next to you pulling the same type of lever the only difference is your lever has 10 times the output as you're running in and looking through AI Technologies focus on the tools and the technology that allows you to do more with less 30 minutes of work in two hours of output five lines of text created a whole blog for code completions four functions written run a single script scaffold an entire application these are just a few examples of scaling your impact and focusing on doing more with less this single principle can take you to the moon and Beyond during the noise of the AI boom Focus On Tools technology and ideas that allow you to do more with less a lot of the AI technology coming out right now is just a bunch of UI wrappers around chat gbt and although that's fantastic and there's value in that it's not going to allow you to do a ton more with less the big Winners will emerge focus on this principle and you'll know when these winners emerge bet on always people always want better faster cheaper social connecting engaging products these are things you can place massive bets on so as the slew of AI technology comes out focus on not just getting more with less but focus on the fundamental human value behind the technology or tool here are some more examples people always want lower prices people always want faster Solutions people always want more control people always want additional Comfort people always want entertainment people always want less collateral damage less risk people always want social status people always want confidence and Trust the AI industry is blowing up right now and it can be really hard to stay focused and not get super nervous and worried about job security about what to build next about what tools are important about what tools aren't but I'm hoping that by engaging with these three principles you have an edge and you can think and be more like a Sarah versus a job run in not out more with less bet on always I just want to leave you with these final thoughts remember that in every technological disruption there are people who resist there are people who don't want to move forward they're people who don't want the change because why because the disruption disrupts them it disrupts their comfortable continuous habits their way of life their expertise and remember just like John understood everything about horse carriages he was the expert none of that mattered during the automobile Revolution beware of turning into an old dog that can't learn new tricks especially in the software industry I really like this format where I build in public I write every line of code from scratch and I post it on YouTube you guys can see all of it you can see the whole journey and then I cap it off with a video like this where I talk about what we've built where I kind of you know make it relevant to the overall Narrative of the software industry to help you level set the things you might be building or thinking or learning with what someone else might be building I am 300 all in on AI technology my plan is to become an AI engineer and I want to take you along the journey with me with all of his knowledge John was disrupted Sarah was a disrupter remember when you're feeling that sense of resistance to new things ask yourself do I want to be a Sarah or do I want to be a John thanks for watching drop a like subscribe stay focused keep building and I'll see you in the next one",
