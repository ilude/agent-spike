  "raw_transcript": "the JavaScript developer ecosystem is an absolute nightmare that needs to be simplified if proven true bond is setting itself up to be the JavaScript ecosystem killer but whether or not it survives is up to Engineers like you and me to endorse it by using it whatever new software arises great Engineers ask three questions how much time can I save will this help me solve my problems what are the trade-offs in this video we aim to answer these questions today we're using bun to learn bun so first things first go ahead and install bun I've already got bun installed here let's go to a new directory just going to run bun init all right so let's create some files for us let's go ahead and open up vs code looks like we have a basic application a package a readme with some basic instructions let's go ahead and follow these we're going to run upon install let's go ahead and install some packages that we're going to need to use to build the Prototype application that we're building today bun I we're going to install Cheerio axios and piglet kick off the application looks like Bond run index.ts gets us there nice hello via bun so let's check out that index file and we just have a console log right away just by running this command you can see that there's several processes completely removed from the JavaScript stack right TS node is gone node is gone transpiler is gone and using bun we also installed our dependencies so so far so fantastic the fewer tools you have to use to solve your problem the faster you're going to be able to solve your problem because you're not going to be context switching what are we doing here what are we going to build I want to build a tool that helps us learn and build out examples directly from the bond documentation so let's go to guides and what I want to be able to do is you know for instance we have read a Json file with bun this application is going to accept a URL from bun we're going to paste it in a CLI command we want to copy all the relevant text from this page using a web scraper then we're going to use our favorite AI engineering tool right now ader if you haven't seen the previous ader videos definitely check those out I highly recommend these videos jump into that I'm not going to harp on that too much here in this video but we're going to use ader to help us build out examples that we can theoretically directly just run with bun so let's get into it set up a basic main function we're gonna call Main a couple functions here we're going to do a parse M parse CLI args and we're in typescript let's go ahead and create some types right create a types.ts file we're going to do a involvers and then we're going to do CLI bars right and and mvars let's go ahead and have a memory variable and I'll explain all this when it becomes relevant and then in CLI vars we're going to accept a URL here so let's go ahead and write URL and that's going to be a string perfect let's create the dot m memory slash so there's going to be a directory that we write that's going to store all the contents of the file so that we can use Ada to read it and generate examples for us so we're going to do that and then let's go ahead and create one more we'll call it samples so perfect it's going to be examples and then we'll go ahead and add that here great so let's go ahead and see if we can read these environment variables using Bond setup types import let's return and then let's set up our variables and go ahead and print them out those close types and let's go ahead and just run this basic example and see if we get our and the ncli upon run index.ts and we're going to pass in this URL fantastic so as you can see there we pass in acli ARG comes in parameter two right here and we have our environment variables pulled out from our dot m files we didn't need to import a library as we normally had to more points for bun so far it's allowing us to do more in less time less configuration less setup but let's go ahead and continue building our application so I'm going to go ahead and use fig lit to generate just kind of like a top level message okay it looks like that was too much text there we go bun the JS ego killer all right so let's collapse and open up Main and start working on our URL parsing functionality so what we're going to do is create a function here called scrape we're going to pass in a URL and it's going to give us back a raw string content raw HTML equals scrape and we do CLI dot URL this is going to be pretty simple to try catch all right so now we're going to use axios to scrape the website's content we're going to do a response we'll wait get URL return response to that data and let's go ahead and make sure we have an error here and we're going to do or undefine make the function async of course and that's going to allow us to scrape website content let's go ahead and just quickly run this make sure you have the await scrape okay fantastic so it looks like we got a bunch of HTML content back and if we just copy all this dump it somewhere and search for something let's search for let's see git dependency fantastic so we did scrape this URL obviously there's a lot of noise here we want to parse this down into just the content we're looking for right we're looking for maybe the header and we're looking for the example so we can feed this into our AI tool aider and it can generate full examples for us build that functionality out now in our script to continue testing done and see how far we can push this now I want to get some formatted HTML and we're going to do a weight and we're going to do um parse elements and we're going to pass in the Raw HTML this may not need to be a sync but we'll find out raw HTML string and we'll also get back a string from this functionality then we're going to look at specific blocks of content that we want to read so if we come in here looks like we're going to want to read the H1 and we're going to want to read the code block so let's go ahead and set up our white list for that white list elements H1 and let's go ahead and do H2S as well and it will do dot code block parse the HTML look for these elements and return some type of string we can use to save to a file so that we can have our AI tool Eder read that file and generate full examples for us I don't want to waste your time I'm going to speed through this a little bit all right fantastic so this is our parse elements function don't worry about the details here too much basically we're taking a bunch of HTML recursively looking through and matching our H1s H2S and the code block which corresponds with the content on the page that we want to parse let's clean up our function and make sure that we pass in some content here and then let's see what we get from our formatted HTML all right so if we copy our content here and we just paste it on a new file do a little bit of inspection you can see that we have rh1s and we have all the content within the H1 so that's exactly what we wanted and then we're going to have our code block right here so we also have all the content that was in our code block and you can see here if we just copy a little bit of this file.type up over to the website you can see here that file.type is indeed and that code block div so this is great now we're going to take this content and write it to a file so let's look at buns documentation for how we do that so here's how to read a file all we want to do is write so let's look for that okay so it looks like this is it so red response to a file so we're going to take a path and just write to it so this is super simple looks like bun has this rolled in I'm not going to create a new function for this just because it's so straightforward so let's also generate a name for the file so we'll do file name this is going to be the memory for our agent so let's go ahead and pull in that in variable and let's do a little bit of parsing on the URL that we pass in to generate a file name from that so you can see here we passed in bought at sh Guide Slash read so let's go ahead and get a file name from that so I'll say file name here which changes the file path tli dot URL we're going to do a slice negative two uh and then we'll do a join here I'm gonna split first split on slashes and then we'll grab the last two elements that's going to be read file and Json and then we'll have it here dump that in and then we'll just call it a uh we'll just do a DOT text probably could do a HTML file we'll throw that here we'll go the formatted here we'll await this response and we will just do a simple console log completed on memory file great so let's go ahead and run this on our read file slash Json page so this should read just the important contents we need for a agent to understand how to generate examples let's go ahead and run this all right so we got Bond dot right no such file or directory let's go ahead and generate some folders here so we have memory and then we're going to have examples make sure that's right memory and examples great okay completed button memory file so it looks like we should have a read file json.text let's see if that's true and as you can see we do indeed have that we can change the file mode here let's do HTML and you can see here we have all the content we wanted parse there's some extra junk in here but that doesn't matter too much the underlying model is going to be GPT 4 so it'll parse through all this okay so now we have a cool little application here that tests out bonds capabilities now let's open up our favorite AI engineering tool ader and let's generate some full examples we can run so that we can learn Bond faster with AI check this out I'm going to export my open AI key I'm going to run get a knit I'm going to commit all these files with an empty commit and then I'm going to open up ader again check out the ader videos they're really incredible people really are enjoying them I'm going to do more videos on ader and other AI tools that help you write code faster and get more done quickly for now we're just going to keep rolling and we have our core application ready we can read your rails copy the content into our code base and now we can use ader to use these files as active memory and then take the active memory and build full case examples so how do we do that let's add we're going to say memory redefile Json dot text so now ader has this in its active memory and we can now say the following read and generate a functioning to read files using bun or the example directory and place it in a TS file all right so I've got a little weird error here go ahead and ignore that let's just let bun rip and you can see here it read that file and it is generating a full complete example for us um it's asking if we want to allow the creation of this file of course we're going to hit yes add this file to git as well we're going to go ahead and say yes and now let's go ahead and take a look at that file and as you can see it generated a full example for us a couple things that missed it just copied the path directly let's go ahead and just update this right we can just go directly to our package.json files it imported bun because it doesn't know that bun is in the main namespace totally fine we'll just get rid of that now let's test out some more functionality of bun we should just be able to run this TS file right this is a fully functioning self-contained example let's see if that's true I'm going to open up a new terminal here fun examples read and as you can see this example read our package.json file pulled the Json out of it in Json form and dumped the contents and the type so you can see we have application Json and we have our actual package.json file so this is really cool right kind of a nice combination of two worlds we have ai generating code for us and we're exploring a brand new tool bun and utilizing its core value proposition which is a all-in-one cohesive JavaScript ecosystem let's generate a couple more examples to show off the flexibility of our script here okay so let's find something else we want to do okay this is kind of a cool one let's check if two objects are deep equal to each other so bun has this deep equals function we could just copy this in we could do this all manually we're not going to do that we built out this tool to do that for us so let's copy the URL open up our editor type Bun Run index drop in that URL and let it rip great completed on memory file let's go ahead and open that up and as you can see here it generated those examples for us let's go ahead and validate by just searching for deep equals bam deep equals fantastic let's jump back to ader I'm going to go ahead and get ignore my ader files great and then let's go ahead and stage and commit I'm just gonna do another empty commit and now let's go ahead and add our new memory file utildeep equals that text great now we have that in our memory let's check our token usage we don't have a lot of memory in right now we have 3K we have 1K from the read file Json dot text ader you know is limited by the context of the model which is gpt4 in this case I'm going to go ahead and just blow away the memory read file that text just to get our memory usage down a little bit so we're not loading up a huge bill from openai so let's go ahead and do drop and we're going to drop the memory file json.text perfect remove that kind of run another tokens test that dropped us down to 3.8k great let's go ahead and have ader generate a new fully functioning test where we can check if two objects are deep equal with Bond read memory deep equals and generate stir with a for example we can run is in the global namespace don't import go ahead and have it generate and as you know ader describes the change it's going to make it shows you exactly what it wants to do it looks like it's generating this code right from the example is asking me if I want to allow the creation of the file of course add it to git of course and now that file has been created let's go ahead and check out the example deep equals with bun and as you can see it's got the bond functionality let's go ahead and let it rip Bun Run examples deep bam if we walk through this example we can see that we have a and b and the only result that returns true with deep equals is going to be this Top Value the others are all false and that lines up perfectly with our test all right so there's one more thing that I want to test out that I think is really important and that is Javascript testing let's see if bun can really help us test faster and also can be and also can help us replace just and five tests so let's generate one more fully functioning example with our rapid learning application let's go ahead and look for that in the search test okay so this looks good so run tests so run tests with the bond test Runner so let's go ahead and do this I'm going to copy this URL as we have before and run our rapid learning application on this so we're just going to type Bun Run index passen URL it's going to write this file just as it has the previous ones we can quickly check that out text run you can see it's got a decent amount of content in it create an empty commit let's hop over to ader Let's drop some files to keep our token usage low all right cool so fresh air instance here we're going to add memory run tests Dot txt and now I wanted to generate a fully functioning test for us so that we can test out buns testing functionalities all right so let's see how we can do this right so let's say read memory test run test.txt a fully functioning testing functionality and I'm just going to type this again bond is in the global namespace don't import and let's see how it does okay so it looks like it has a really simple describe test add multiply that's for us I'm going to say yes yes it's going to apply that edit let's go ahead and look at that file Bond Test example all right so it looks like it missed the file naming a little bit so let's go ahead and prove the file name so instead of bunt test we're going to do test dot TS and although we have some red here I'm not going to worry about typing too much here I'm sure there's a simple solution for that I'm just going to go and type BUN test and okay so honestly guys this is pretty incredible uh we're just using the bond command everywhere uh it picked up this bun DOT test uh you know it picked up this Bond test example.test.ts file um and it's just working and obviously this is a small isolated example right we we started a new code base you always have a huge Advantage when you start a brand new code base let's acknowledge that but all I've been doing is typing and it's incredible there's I'm not context switching to you know webpack to uh just to divide tests uh I'm not loading up um you know dot m to parse environment variables I didn't do anything fancy for the CLI Arc you know we have file writing file reading kind of built in and tons more data Guide so so pretty incredible uh I gotta say the you know taking a kind of uh first couple passes at this I'm pretty impressed it looks like there's a lot going on here is bun the JavaScript ecosystem killer my vote is on yes of course this is just one example it's super isolated and there's a lot more going on here and you really have to push and test this so you know that's what I'm going to do we're gonna see where this breaks down surely it breaks down somewhere just like that we built out a really simple application and also just want to call this out we did use both common JS and es6 modules in the same file if you've been coding for even just five years you know that this has and was a really huge pain and Bun just glossed over it for us right it's just abstracting away the problems and that's what makes a great tool you don't have to think about the unimportant work so jumping back to the first three questions how much time can I save using bun a lot of time it's encapsulating the entire JS ecosystem and a single command called bun um will it help you solve your problems yes existing tools will do that it's looking like this will help you do it faster right and what trade-offs do you have to make to learn this tool um surely you're going to need to check out some new documentation you're going to need to migrate over to some of the bond functionality if you want their performance improvements but it looks like it's a drop-in replacement for node that's what they boast they say it's mostly a you know it's it's this I think they said virtually somewhere which you know you have to take that with a grain of salt but you know the real selling point here for me is I am just bonding everything you just bon bon bon bon bon right you call bun everywhere and it's really incredible and honestly refreshing to not have to jump between 10 different tools that you don't care about you only care about them because it helps you solve your problem right since we've built this we can kind of you know boil down their landing page to a couple of really really crucial points okay so they have a bunch of built-in apis good they're going to be faster because they can rebuild them using the latest and greatest Tech you know node is going to have a harder time with that because it has to support a ton and ton of ton of Legacy users right the other technology is they're slower they have a lot more baggage they have Legacy code right that makes things run slower you can't just update to the latest greatest coolest that may be buns biggest Advantage right it's kind of starting fresh faster apis fantastic the speed is there it's it's a nice to have honestly if the speed wasn't here I would still be thinking about using it right elegant apis just like we talked about very good but the real kicker here the thing that should be attracting you to using bun is this this should not be the third bullet point this should be the header of the entire website cohesive DX can complete toolkit for JavaScript apps package manager test Runner bundler this is the reason I will be using bun I'll be trying bun I'll be testing it I'll be seeing where its limitations are I'll be looking for those trade-offs we're talking about right this is what it's all about the DX let's not just talk about the good right we're software Engineers we can't fix it on just the good things right let's talk about the the risks honestly I don't think it's a question of can bun replace the JavaScript ecosystem I think this can and should be done and it looks like bun is setting themselves up to do it the red flag I'm seeing here is bun is owned by a company called oven this is a VC back private company do you know what VC back companies want um one thing money right so kind of a hidden risk here but uh to me the biggest risks isn't that it won't work it's that it does replaces the entire ecosystem and then sets up some cash grab scheme five years down the line when the whole JS ecosystem is in love with Bond I'm not against private companies at all I'm not saying it wouldn't be worth it to pay to make all these JavaScript problems go away you know the JavaScript tool chain has so many problems and it again it's just frustrating to work with the DX has gotten so you know fudged I just want to call it out to me that seems like the biggest risk I I don't think that this is where their heads out uh I think they probably understand that ecosystem risk and they don't want to create any type of lock-in like that you would at least hope but you know just want to put that on your radar as you're thinking about trying this out you know as you're looking through whether you want to spend your precious time learning a new software technology that may or may not work out and even if it does work out you know what are the trailers of that I just want to call it out for you right now right here in less than an hour we built out a brand new kind of Rapid learning tool thanks to all the great bun commands that we have the unified JavaScript experience that Bond brings is really special thanks to that we were able to set up a brand new application and almost no time install dependencies you know get some code out and utilize ader to read the downloaded files to generate full-scale functioning examples which were pretty incredible to see run by just running bun on the file so you know my consensus is I'm going to be using Bond any new project script is going to have bun behind it I am going to be looking out for limitations and of course if I see any of those limitations I'm going to let you guys know here on the channel and just to kind of reiterate you know what this channel is all about I'm looking for functional useful non-hype train technology I can use and I can share with you to help you accomplish your engineering goals but also to help you get an edge in you know the age of AI that we're in at the end of the day software is about helping us solve problems feel free to like sub and join the journey so that's it hope you enjoyed the video give it a like sub I'll see you guys in the next one",
