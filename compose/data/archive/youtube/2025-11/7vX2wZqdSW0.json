  "raw_transcript": "The last thing that I want to call out is templatization. And this is something that, you know, we have gone after for a long time. If if you've ever done consulting, people talk about templatizing your services all the time. The difference with AI is that AI enables you to do much much more interesting things with templates. Prompts can be living templates. Templates can be extended through prompting at the end of the end of the engagement surface with the client. templates themselves become more customized and distinct service offerings because AI makes it so easy to extend tokens to the value chain that the customer is bringing. This is reflective of the fact that software itself is changing. Software can be more customized now because it is so cheap to write code. Similarly, consulting can be more focused on individual customers than was practical before and still utilize the power of templates because it's cheaper to customize those templates Down.",

    "description": "My site: https://natebjones.com\nMy substack: https://natesnewsletter.substack.com/\nStory: https://natesnewsletter.substack.com/p/the-end-to-end-ai-client-value-playbook?r=1z4sm5\n\nTakeaways\n 1. Distribution Is King: Consultants who already own client relationships can scale fastest\u2014provided their AI advice is substantive, not surface-level.\n 2. Kill the AI-Wash: Buzzword-heavy pitches (\u201cAI-powered everything\u201d) destroy credibility; clients expect clear, technically sound answers like when RAG is appropriate.\n 3. Own a Specific Domain: Wrap AI around deep sector expertise\u2014much like a strangler fig\u2014so your niche authority and pricing power grow together.\n 4. Package With Living Templates: AI lets templates evolve in real time, making services sharply scoped yet highly customizable for each engagement.\n 5. Build a Trusted Network: No one covers the full value chain; cultivate specialist partners so you can bring the right \u201cJames\u201d to every project.\n 6. Publish to Prove Credibility: Sharing detailed, NDA-safe insights publicly separates you from the sea of generic \u201cAI consultants\u201d and fuels referrals.\n\nQuotes\n\u201cWe don\u2019t need more AI slogans; we need consultants who can answer, \u2018When should I use RAG\u2014and why?\u2019\u201d\n\u201cA strangler-fig strategy works: grow AI expertise around the trunk of the domain you already dominate.\u201d\n\u201cIf you AI-wash today, you don\u2019t just lose the deal\u2014you poison the whole ecosystem tomorrow.\u201d\n\nSummary\nI argue that great AI consultants win by combining genuine domain mastery with deep, specific AI fluency rather than vague \u201cAI-washing.\u201d Distribution still rules, so leverage an existing book of business or build one through clear, public content that showcases expertise. Focus on a narrow niche, articulate concrete deliverables, and back them with living, AI-enabled templates. Cultivate trusted partners for adjacent parts of the value chain and stay transparent to avoid poisoning the ecosystem with overhyped claims. When consultants pair granular knowledge with credible, outcome-oriented packages, they command higher fees and earn the long-term trust that keeps clients coming back.\n\nKeywords\nAI consulting, distribution, AI-washing, domain expertise, specificity, RAG, templates, partnerships, content marketing, trust, value chain, niche, client retention",
