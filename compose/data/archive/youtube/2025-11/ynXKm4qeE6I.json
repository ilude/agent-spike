  "raw_transcript": "what's up guys i'm here with another video today we're talking about pina and view 3. i'm going to show you how to set up and get started with pina from xero in under 10 minutes so at the bottom of the screen you can see i have a little timer going this is an application i built called time ba that also uses pina and i use it to manage my time feel free to check it out if you like in the description let's jump into it refresh the browser and get rid of all the boilerplate here i'm gonna set up some header tags so we're using pinion view 3 and we're going to create two micro apps here a simple counter application and then we're going to create a cool tier list where we'll rank front-end frameworks and both these sections are just to explore pina as a state management system so in the main ts first thing you have to do is use pina so we're going to call that on the view application here and now we're going to create our store file so i have a code snippet here let me know if you're interested in that comment down below and i'll share my snippets with you guys okay so now we're creating two variables uh in our state function so i'm gonna go ahead and add count and tier list and now i'm creating the interface for the tier list so we have the rank and the title each object will have a rank and a title the rank will allow us to sort our items and the title will display what the item represents now i'm typing out the store interface and of course that's just going to be the count and the tier list so pin your stores have three primary key value pairs you can see the state getters and actions the state is where all of our variables live the getters allow us to create computer properties basically it allows us to combine our state and add business logic right into our store and the actions allow us to mutate our state and make api requests so right now i'm just typing out the sorted tier list so i am taking the tier list and then i'm sorting it by rank and i have a little issue here because the state object is not yet typed out with typescript so i'm just going to drop in the as store interface here and that should fix that issue awesome and now i'm going to jump into the actions and start adding all the mutations i want to make to the state so with pina you can modify your state directly i don't recommend doing that i think it's always better to type out how your state will be modified explicitly just to keep things really simple and you'll always know when things are getting updated and if there's some issue you can always you know pop a console.log in inside your mutation all right so just writing out all these functions we have increment reset promote demote and add tier so promote i'm going to increase the rank d mode i'm going to decrease the rank and add t i'm going to create a new tier item just add this to the list and that should do it for our store pretty quickly we created all the state and modifications to our state that we need so let's hop over to the app.view file and get some imports rolling so we import use store from our store file and we're going to need this store to refs function from pina for our new tier list item i'm going to go ahead and create a reference called new item so that we can create new tier list items and when you're using pina you'll call your store as a function and set it to a variable and then you use the store to refs variable which will create view three references from your store that are automatically updated when your store changes all right so i'm going to go ahead and create a button here that calls that store increment function and store reset function two buttons and it looks like i have a little bug uh it's because i forgot to call createpina as a function so knock that out and let's jump back over to app.view and set up our count variable to be displayed in our account header so you can see increment and reset buttons working there our state is updating so everything's looking great all right so let's jump into a more complex example of using pina as a state management system so i'm going to create a tier list here so let's get some styles running um we're creating a loop to loop over all of our tier items again let me know if you want my code snippets i can drop some of them in a file for you guys that's no problem just working on some html structure here so i'm going to display the title and the rank and then we're going to create two buttons promote and demote and of course when they're clicked they're going to call their respective functions with their index so that they can update the proper element in the list let's add some emojis to just display that up versus down promote versus demo functionality and now we're going to add our html for our new tier list item so i'm using v-model here for two-way data binding all that really means is you know if i update the new item state in html versus in javascript it'll update both sides i added the add tier add item button and now we're moving on to some styles here so just getting some basic structure for the display just to make it a little more presentable all right so i'm going to add some default tier list items here like i mentioned before we're going to use front-end frameworks as our tier items so here i'm creating view 3 at the top of course and i'm going to add two more default items probably we'll do react and maybe spelt so adding react.js here and let's add svelt and let's give them some rankings and then we're going to save and see the hot reload happen here cool i'm just going to continue with some styling um should be almost finished with the styling let me know if you want any specific tutorials over some of the styling i'm using or the html setup i'm using all right you can see here i can promote and demote but i did notice that my list isn't getting sorted and that's because i'm using the state variable instead of the getter property all right so now you can see here when i increment um my rank appears to be coming in backwards so i'm going to go ahead and flip those variables in my getter and you can see here when i promote and demote the tier item is moving up and down the list so let's go ahead and add view js2 so you can see that in the tier lists and i can increment so you can see i can promote and demote these items so right now we got vue.js three in the top of course and that's pretty much it so you know in the matter of 10 minutes i've set up a store and got it working in a component you know very simply um you know if you've used vox or you know redux or other state management systems you know it's it's usually a lot more overhead than this so that's why pina is so great it's just simple it's just what you need there are tons more features but this will be 90 of what you'll need in the state management system which is fantastic all right and that's it that is how you use pina in your view apps as you can see it's simple it's fast and you can get your projects up and running in no time i hope this video helps you on your developer journey let me know if you're interested in any of my code snippets i used to build out this project feel free to reach out for any reason if this video helped you definitely like comment and subscribe in success or failure i'll see you in the next one [Music]",
