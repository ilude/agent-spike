  "raw_transcript": "We are in a power law game and power law costs and returns show up across AI. That means uh AI is increasing according to a power law. So it's increasing exponentially. I talked about that. It also means you get power law returns from gambling on AI as a business. And I gambling is probably the wrong word. Betting on AI as a business. Essentially, if you invest in something and there's a power law return, it's rational to invest more than you usually would. And we've seen that pattern play off across companies investing in AI, but also across model makers. model makers investing a billion dollars in AI talent or whatever it is as Zuck did, model makers investing a huge amount in chips. All of that is a way of saying we think there's disproportionate returns on AI and we are going to keep investing very very heavily in order to harvest those returns.",

    "description": "My site: https://natebjones.com\nMy substack: https://natesnewsletter.substack.com/\nThe story: https://open.substack.com/pub/natesnewsletter/p/ai-bubble-why-the-doom-narrative?r=1z4sm5&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&showWelcomeOnShare=true\n\nTakeaways\n 1. Narrative Swings Drive Bubble Talk: A mix of hype disappointment (GPT-5 rollout), layoffs, and Sam Altman\u2019s \u201cbubble\u201d comment created the perfect conditions for a doom narrative.\n 2. Chatbot Plateau: The chat interface is reaching saturation\u2014further model improvements won\u2019t feel as dramatic to end users.\n 3. Progress Shifts to Agentic Use Cases: Real breakthroughs are happening in complex workflows and proofs, but these are harder to grasp than chatbot gains.\n 4. Benchmarks Show Exponential Gains: Non-saturated benchmarks like METR still demonstrate accelerating AI capability growth.\n 5. Chip Scarcity Reflects Demand: Both OpenAI and Anthropic admit they\u2019re under-allocated on chips, showing strong underlying demand, not weakness.\n 6. Restructuring = Refocusing: Meta\u2019s layoffs are less about retreat than reorganizing around inference and next-stage gains.\n 7. Power Law Dynamics: AI investment and returns follow power laws, rewarding outsized bets and forcing firms to specialize in their niches.\n\nQuotes\n\u201cWe are in a world where model makers are showing exponential gains in model performance and we are very early in seeing how that lands with business.\u201d\n\u201cIf it really was a bubble, we wouldn\u2019t all be complaining about it\u2014instead, we would all be hyping it up.\u201d\n\u201cWith any gold rush you get people rushing in to stake a claim, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s inherently a bubble.\u201d\n\nSummary\nThe current AI \u201cbubble\u201d narrative is driven by hype swings, layoffs, and public comments, but the reality is more nuanced. While chatbots are plateauing, progress continues in harder-to-see agentic use cases. Benchmarks show exponential gains, demand for chips is still outstripping supply, and corporate restructurings signal refocus rather than retreat. AI adoption is a power law game: most projects fail, but the successes deliver existential 10x returns, making heavy investment rational. Far from an AI winter, we are entering a phase where the biggest value will come from specialized, high-impact business use cases beyond chat.\n\nKeywords\nAI bubble, GPT-5, Sam Altman, MIT study, enterprise AI, agentic use cases, Meta layoffs, chip scarcity, exponential benchmarks, METR, power law dynamics, AI investment, Anthropic, OpenAI, business AI adoption, AI winter",
