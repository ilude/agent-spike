  "raw_transcript": "let's go ahead and deploy our Google Cloud serverless function this composable function just does something simple it just flashes a Dom element just like that we now have a use add class function that temporarily adds an animation to a Dom element let's create a vue.js composable functions generator built on Google Cloud functions create a new Google Cloud project authenticate with Google Cloud SDK there are tons of videos that do this already I'm going to skip over this and focus on the actual content we're going to set up the initial project build a serverless function where the llm test deploy and then lastly we're going to build a bash function that's going to call this API that we're going to build and give us back a brand new vue.js composable function based on our query let's Jump Right In first I'm going to set up the project add your git ignore and then set up these environment variables I'm using open AI so we're going to have an open AI key and I'm going to use my own personal secret key so no one else can access this serverless endpoint fill these values in in the dot m and the dot m.yaml file here's the yaml file foreign foreign okay so I have a basic Google Cloud serverless function setup right now we're turning 200. I created a dev.sh file to start the server and then I created a Dev curl.sh file to query our local endpoint next we're going to build out the servos function and then we're going to query the llm to build our vue.js composable function foreign foreign all right thank you foreign [Music] okay so as you can see here we passed in a query we pass in a model built our llm chat completion here just using classic GPT and we built a prompt example that details out how to create vue.js composable functions and then we built a prompt that specifies how GPT should act and behave and how it's going to generate our new vue.js composable functions after we built that module we simply just added a couple parameters here we have our query our model our secret P which I can make sure the secret key matches you can add additional checks and balances here and then we're simply generating the response we return 200 and then we move forward from there when we called this using our Dev curl script it gave us a brand new vue.js composable function this composable function just does something simple it just flashes a Dom element and it looks like it's going to just do it once so it's going to flash it and then it's going to revert it back original color and it returns this flash function that can be used in any VHS component that you're building awesome so now that we know that that's working let's go ahead and deploy our Google Cloud serverless function all right so while this is deploying let me just talk about what just happened there so I created a deploy.sh script this is the file that uses the Google Cloud SDK and the command line to deploy your serverless function I can definitely create a video going more in depth into this process specifically but basically all we're doing here is we're we're telling Google Cloud platform where exactly our function is which is the generate composable entry point here it's going to scan our files it's going to look for a file there with Main you can see the sources there and then it's going to look for that function name which is the name of our function and as you can see we are deploying here so if you want more Google cloud content if you want more serverless function content definitely let me know drop a comment feel free to sub and I can definitely create more content like that for you guys okay so awesome so our serverless function deployed you can see here use composable and we now have a new endpoint so let's go ahead and test it out what I'm going to do here is create a new sh file that hits this production endpoint all right and now that that function is deployed we should be able to just run our prod curl.sh script okay and just like that we have a deployed serverless function on Google Cloud functions and if you go into the Google Cloud console and check your Cloud functions you should see that you have a brand new serverless function all right awesome so now that we have that deployed we can go into our final step which is to build a batch function to call the serverless function we can then move this into our bash RC or bash profile and then have access to building view composable functions anywhere from our terminal okay so as you can see here we called Source function to activate our function and add this new VCF view composable function onto the state space of our terminal we then called VCF we gave your string which is the composable that we want to generate in this case we're generating a composable that keeps track of mouse position whenever the mouse moves and as you can see here it returned a new vue.js composable function so let's see what this looks like so this looks great we have our Imports at the top use Mouse position we have some State references we have track Mouse position and then it's going to return our X Y whenever the mouse moves and we can detect that the mouse has moved because we've set up a on mounted hook or should I say our llm set up a on mounted hook that has the mouse move event listener so just like that with a single command line call we now have the capability to generate the vue.js composable functions let's go ahead and generate a couple more view composable functions so we can get the feel for how useful and valuable that this is I'm going to go ahead and update the name here to use composable run Source on this file and then generate some new composable functions for instance we can create a new composable that determines if the device we're on is a mobile device or a desktop device and just like that you now have a view composable that lets you know if the device is mobile or not let's build another I want to view composable function that allows me to temporarily add a CSS animation to a Dom element all right and again just like that we now have a use add class function that temporarily adds an animation to a Dom element so you can see here we have the class name and then we have the add class function that gets passed in and on a timer it will activate and then deactivate that CSS class and you can see here thanks to our specific prompt we have a usage example so we always have an example with every single composable function that we generate I hope this was helpful for you guys I hope that you can see the potential of not only Google Cloud functions to quickly deploy serverless functions but also the power of chat GPT combined with you know whatever front-end framework you're working with whatever technology you're working with you can generate all this stuff on the Fly using chatgpt using other llms let your imagination fly use this as inspiration use this as an example to help you build out your personal workflow productivity enhancements one of the key areas I'm focused on is how can I use this technology to make me faster at building the things I want to build if you like content like this where we dig into useful applications of modern technology feel free to drop a like feel free to subscribe on this channel I really want to focus on helping you build your next thing that means being up to date with the latest techniques and strategies as well as tools like Google Cloud serverless functions or chat GPT or vue.js composable functions whatever it might be I want to help you develop your thing faster",
