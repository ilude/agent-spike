  "raw_transcript": "imagine a network of chat gbts doing work for you while you sleep work and chill maybe they're coding a new app you don't have time to build or maybe they're building the perfect study plan for your next final whatever it might be the agent Network can do the work for you while you sleep if nothing else 2023 has shown us gpt3 gpt4 and llms as a whole are extremely powerful but they're not powerful enough to truly run end to end to complete tasks for us in the last video we created the first version of this Vision a network of AI agents working together while we sleep in this video I want to show you V1 and V2 of the agent Network and then give away the view GPT component generation prompt I've been using to generate View minutes in seconds it also just happens to be the first agent I have up and running so real quick let's recap the one so as you can see here we have several agents inside of this kind of diagram here so you know zoom in we can scroll around we can click and move and edit them we can click on their edges click on the nodes individually not a lot going on here I'm using a JS Library called cytoscape let's reset and let's hit add agent so you can see here we're adding a bunch of Agents and it's pretty cool we can just keep adding and then we can randomize the connections so you can see here we have a bunch of nodes pointing to each other and you know you can imagine you have a bunch of Agents maybe this is the um you know python generation agent and then this is the python validator agent and then this is the python tester agent and you know you can imagine a slew of Agents working together basically to compose a bunch of llm props their responses and working together to solve a specific problem right so we can also animate the items to go to a different color that's kind of cool just testing out some functionality there and then let me show you the payload let me show you what this looks like exactly under the hood so we can dump and you can see all the agents and their nodes that they're pointed to so pretty simple structure one last feature I want to show off let's reset a couple agents randomize the connections and then we can run save so as you saw in the last video if you haven't checked that out definitely do so we're using nuxt and we're using versal KV so the new versal store that basically just is backed by Reddit so pretty cool so now if I refresh and load agents you can see we got all the agents loaded agents loaded and if I you know randomize connections add an agent add a couple agents and then save you can see we got the agent saved it lets me refresh load agents and there you go so that's pretty cool just using redis as a back-end store obviously not what you want to do long term or maybe it is but I just wanted to get something up and running and I also want to test out versal KB to see how simple it was so as you can see V1 is pretty simple it's just the kind of you know UI and a simple store so let's go ahead and move on to V2 this is V2 of the Asian Network as you can see we got a UI upgrade let's just go ahead and jump into a real example right so you can hit this add real agent and now you can see we're creating an AI agent so the AI agent has a name I want to go ahead and say uh real view agent let's call it the view GPT and then the agent URL have a URL set up here and then the parameter name which is going to be queries I'm going to hit add and now you can see we have a single agent view GPT which is pretty cool and now if I click this agent I get to agent the endpoint and now I have this query text field so this is where I'm going to you know specify the exact query I want to run to generate New View components let's do create a accepts two props and disabled if disabled don't allow switching let's go ahead and run the query all right so you can see it fired off so we now have agent queries that we can view and we can see that view GPT has a prompt and a response and we have an A here because it's still loading so we're just going to wait for that to fill in awesome so as you can see we have the prompt and we have the response so we can scroll and see all the content obviously it isn't super useful in this form but if we hit copy response move over to our editor and dump the text here you can see that it generated a entire vue.js component so and it looks like it's right we have uh you know the template section [Music] check box on off we got the disabled just like we asked for we have the checked and then we have that on off prop it's making them reactive and then we have this toggle switch here let's say that it has made a mistake right this is still done 99 of the work of generating a vgs component which is awesome you know in the background this endpoint is basically just a chatgpt wrapper but the idea is that you don't need to know or care what the agents are doing in the background right I only care that I can connect to some URL give it some prompt and then get a response right so I'm going to go ahead and hit save agent here and then I'm going to go ahead and refresh so just want to show off that we have that same loading functionality so I loaded the queries there so you can see here we have all of our agents there that's just hitting a we're at a store and saving the prompting response and then I'm going to go ahead and hit load Asian again right so just like that we have a new component we can add a couple mock agents so just like that we have a new agent that we can come to and run its specific functionality one of the big problems that engineers and Builders are running into right now and just people using chat GPT is how do we organize all of our prompts how do we visualize all the functionality we have I think that the agent network is going to be the way to do that so anyway um that is version two so you know the whole idea is that now I can add arbitrary agents at any endpoint that do any work it really this just pings an endpoint and specifies a parameter but it's targeted toward agents that's that are going to run and eventually these agents are going to and back out these agents are going to be communicating with each other right so right now I just have one you know view GPT component these other ones are just mock components you can see here there's nothing going on but if I click on this you know we get the query and everything but if I click on this we get the query and the endpoint you can imagine after some time we just have this view GPT component right now but in the future it's going to point to another agent right and this agent could be a composer agent it could be a tester agent that tests The View gbt generated component to make sure that it's right it also could just be like a memory store so you know imagine that this node isn't an agent it's you know a separate memory store that we want to write to and then we want another agent to pull from that memory store and do work from I think that the applications here are pretty wide the biggest problem that this agent network is going to solve is so what does this do what does this get you in the end right and this is going to help you build up a library of prompts agents that all are working together to solve a larger problem for you and then you can come to this single interface and consume you know all the output all your inputs and and build learn whatever your tasks are the agent network is there to help you do that so let me show you the prompt that I'm using for the view GPT component I know that having view in a title is definitely going to attract some view Engineers so let's go ahead and look at the prompt so I have this up in a guess I'll definitely link this in the description so you know view GPT automatically generates view three script setup Lang TS components like a boss The Prompt is here so you know check this out try this out works best with gbt4 uh replace this section here with your query you can use this text as a standalone if you want to set up this python simple python application that basically runs this feel free to do so you have the main.py file and then you have viewgpt.py which contains the functionality to hit the openai endpoint with both the view Example The View prompt and just a couple helper methods here that's going to be in the description if you're a view engineer definitely check this out I use this very prompt to build a lot of my view components now it's a really great way to get 90 of the component done so that's a high level let's go ahead and look at the code just for a quick second I don't want to dive into this too much but I just want to give you a high level idea of what's going on just in case you want to build something for yourself or if you're interested in how it works so at the top level here I have the index.view file inside of a nuxt application so pretty standard Knox application and I have one agent's component and then I have a bunch of load save update function so we have load agent save agent update and then we have the same thing for the queries and so this directly maps to you know this entire agent Network here and all this is doing is basically we have some reference at the top level here and then we have a couple of load and save calls which hit the API agent Network which is some of the nux server backend methods so that's all that's doing so all the juicy stuff happens inside of Agents so let's go ahead and hop into agents for a moment and let's minimize everything here so we can get a high level idea so in the template we have a couple sections here so we have these hidden sections we have the add the prompt and then the responses and then we have all of our controls right the controls are you know all of our buttons here so nothing too crazy happening there we have a lot of omit calls and inside of the styling you can see classic view three component stuff here's an agent hook and then it's just a bunch of component Logic the kind of big core here is that we're using side escape so here it is so setup side escape so all links side escape in the description as well but basically you specify the style you specify what happens when you tap and you specify your container you specify the layout so really great way to visualize and handle node graph based visualizations so that's basically that I just wanted to drop and show the code off a little bit you know when those buttons are clicked when things are happening there it bubbles up to the top component which then runs save and load functionality that then hits the nux server API backend which you can see here bam so you can see agent Network git post let me know if you're interested in a separate nux video I can go into details on how you know this is all wired up I love Knox because you can get up and running running view very quickly you have to get used to the opinionated um directory structure but in reality you end up rebuilding this by yourself there's a quick walk through the code this is the agent network with the first agent view GPT subscribe if you want to see version 3 version 4 and Beyond and drop a like if this tool looks interesting and feel free to comment if you have any ideas for new or novel features I'm building this in public I want to share my progress I want to get your input you know especially as a Vu engineer I'm going to be using lots of view things lots of python things so if that interests you like subscribe follow all that good stuff thank you so much for watching stay focused and keep building I'll see you in the next one",
