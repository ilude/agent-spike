  "raw_transcript": "what's up coders first things first this is not going to be a cool fun heavily added exciting fast-paced video so if that's what you're looking for please click away this is going to be a in-depth serious discussion about living a balanced life as solopreneurs Indie hackers micropreneurs whatever you want to call yourself with aspirations of building your own software building your own business creating something of value outside of your work and living a life that isn't just work nine to five hang out chill and do nothing until you're old we want a little more from life we want to create we want to push ourselves we want to create more I don't see enough Engineers talking about the reality of trying to be a great engineer while building your own software while working full-time while having relationships and commitment and passions I've tossed together this like pseudo presentation in figma to help us just guide the conversation so you know the important question here is how can we create balanced lives as solopreneurs Indie hackers micropreneurs so how can we do that I think first we have to address how reality actually works right uh I would love to believe that we can do everything right that you can code that you can have your career that you can have your relationships that you can have the fun and the passion I would love to believe that you can and we can just do it all right um but this is not how reality Works uh the truth is we're limited on time we simply cannot do everything we simply cannot be great at everything right so this type of way of visualizing um time management and living a balanced life it is inaccurate right so this doesn't work this is not how things work let's let's move on right so what if we try to visualize balance on like a bar chart right so for instance you know we have coding career relationships fun passion and at different times in life we're allocating different amounts of energy and time to each one of them this is pretty good this is a more accurate representation but this isn't a perfect visualization of our time and how we can balance things because it doesn't account for limited resources right we're limited every day so this is close but not quite there okay this is reality right every day we wake up and we have 24 hours to code to work on our career to hang out with family and friends to have fun to let loose a little bit have a couple drinks right and to enjoy our passions we have 24 hours every single day until we die roughly right in reality we don't really have 24 hours we have 12. but just for the sake of the argument you have 24 and so every day that goes by we have another day right another day another day and and constantly we're running out of these days right so every day we're running out right every single day or running out of time if you want to visualize life you have to think of it more like a pie chart right every day is one pie okay so this is reality okay this is if we want to think about how we can allocate our time visually um this is the best way to do it life day to day is like a pie chart right um it's limited we have to slice our pie and allocate our most important resource time throughout different areas of our life okay so for instance right some days we're gonna be coding working our career relationships and then fun and passion uh you know suffer or don't get as much attention and then other days we're going to be having more fun we're going to be doing you know maybe more coding working on our or spending time in our relationships whatever it might be okay but I just want to nail in the idea that if you want to prioritize and live a balanced life a key takeaway is your time is limited every single day something must win right and so that kind of gets to our next slide so the trick of balance is prioritizing what matters most okay and the LIE of balance is trying to do everything with equal effort okay this is kind of something that hit me really hard this year and you know I'm just going to be really straightforward with you guys really open about this like I basically blew up one of the most important relationships in my life this year by over prioritizing coding and career and passion and not spending enough time on fun and relationships just to be totally straightforward the reality is something always wins if you leave with nothing else from this video just remember that every single day when you're allocating your time something always wins there's always something you're going to be doing the most that are always prioritized over others okay this is just complete fake news right balance equality is an illusion you cannot wake up and allocate four hours of the day to coding relationships fun passion and career equal right you just really can't do that um even if you time block it and try to measure everything perfectly I guarantee you something is going to spill over maybe you'll have more fun in one of these areas like fun maybe something will come up maybe you'll be interrupted whatever it might be right even just thinking of like your day-to-day full-time job right that's nine to five even if you fudge that a little bit right that's more than half of your waking hours so okay so if balance is a lie how can we prioritize okay so this is kind of the core of the video right I just want to relate to this question right like balancing is hard [Music] um so something always wins so how can we prioritize what matters um and I would love to hear you guys thoughts on this you know I'm still working on this I'm still working through this I don't have a great answer but I have several strategies now to prevent my mistake my biggest mistake of 2022 which was um under prioritizing my key relationships what are some strategies we can use to make sure that we're prioritizing the right things based on the results we want to see right so let's just talk about one strategy right go all in all right so this was this has been my strategy it's really fun uh it's a great way to get done and really scale your efforts um you know pick what you want the most for any reason you can and go all in this will give you big results right because the idea here is you know we're allocating our waking hours to one or two one or two areas of our life and we're going all in day after day after day this is really great if you have the time and the resources and if people understand that that's where you're at right like this is how you become the 10x coder the you know NX code or whatever you want to say right because after you do this day after day after day after day after day after day you're really really really making massive impact on this area of your life right and this can be anything right this could be you know coding relationships career whatever it is whatever your focus is oh going all in is going to give you asymmetric results the problem of course is that everything else suffers right and this was my strategy this is no longer my strategy just to be totally like blood like like my balancing strategy my you know life balancing strategy has changed this year due to the Fallout of this I'm glad that I know how to do this right because not everyone can go all in it's a skill it takes serious Focus to wake up every single day and go all in on one activity um but keep in mind this costs right I'm sure you've heard the stories of Engineers like destroying their health um you know relationships getting exploded uh they lose their passions right no one does anything anymore except for just work right that's the cost of going all in right if you're all in over here you're all out somewhere else so that's strategy one strategy two is counterbalancing so I have become a big fan of the strategy just to briefly talk about counterbalancing you basically Let Yourself Go kind of all in in a few areas of your life and once things start to fill out of balance or you're feeling some tugging and pulling uh just jump out right switch back um this might seem like obvious but like this strategy is really great for getting some of those all-in results while maintaining balance in the other areas of your life so right now I'm kind of working with strategy to [Music] um I really want to commit to this more the idea here is just to give you guys some ideas on how you can balance and prioritize your life as an engineer who wants to get and more in life so strategy three don't overthink it let life just Loosely pull you in whatever Direction I'm not really a huge fan of this um I don't think you get great results in life from letting Life direct you versus you directing where you want to go but this is a great strategy um just like in a maintenance phase you know we always talk about Sprints and you know like agile workflows right we're doing Sprint Sprint sprints this is kind of like jogging let's say you design a prioritization workflow for yourself where three weeks you're working you're running strategy two right your counterbalancing your life you're going all in you're doing some resting you know then maybe you switch to strategy three for a week and you're like okay this week we're just going to chill we're gonna do some reflecting um we're not going to overthink things this week we're going to be more balanced right this is super solid right um [Music] this works you have to be aware because if you let life pull you in any direction you're not gonna attain huge results right you're kind of at the mercy of all the things you have going on in your life I want to focus in on this idea of how do you accomplish everything you want you can't right uh again to jump back to the pie right you have to think of your days as pies every day you have the same amount of time to choose who you're going to be and what you're going to do right you have the same amount of time uh so how do you accomplish everything you can't you can accomplish what you can in 24 hours and then you can wake up and try to accomplish the same thing again or change so that means you have to prioritize right again I just want to really nail this idea at home like the idea of complete balance of quality throughout your entire life is just a lie you can't do it it's just as damaging as trying to go all in on one area of your life for a prolonged period of time the basic way to think about this is you can accomplish less but do more so you're spreading yourself out right you're spreading yourself thin across several different things this is great for when you're in periods where lots of things you need your attention but not in depth right you're not going to get any great results from jumping around to all the areas of your life okay and then on the flip side you can accomplish more but do less now I'm just a huge fan of this you accomplish more but you do less right so this means acknowledging that your pie is limited that your pie is finite and in order to get great deep results you need to do fewer things right and you need to sacrifice your time and you need to give up some things so that you'll have better results later if you're doing less you have more time and energy to do the few things you're doing very well and this is where the all in and the counterbalancing strategy really shine so I don't know this was kind of just like me blabbing about life balance but I think there's some value in this I want to wrap here let's just talk about the key ideas of creating and living a balanced life as an engineer who wants more from life right so what are the what are the key takeaways that we've briefly discussed here right so true balance equality is something always wins okay every day we're Limited by our time and energy life is like a pie right and number three prioritize what matters most but don't let your life fall but don't let other elements of your life suffer Beyond repair so I think I think this is a good place to stop there are some ideas here here's some key takeaways that help you can pull from this video um True Balance equality is a lie something always wins okay life is like a pie every day we're limited by our time and energy again uh as much as we'd like to think we can do everything we can't so understanding and knowing where your limits are personally and how you can best spend them is really important because over time day after day after day that's how you're going to get those asymmetric results based on the activity that you invest in the most all right and that leads us number three prioritize what matters most but don't let the other elements in your life suffer Beyond repair I think it's really important to like Let Yourself Go and like live in that for a little bit but there will always be a point where something else in your life is suffering and if it goes too far too long without your attention the results are going to be catastrophic and it's going to be really hard it's gonna be really hard to come back from that so that's what I wanted to talk about today guys I really appreciate your time I hope you got some value out of this I know this wasn't my usual content and I know it's been a while since I've posted a video but you know frankly I've just been going through a lot of personal life stuff and I'm really happy to be back making some YouTube videos making Tech content making life solopreneur content with and for you guys my solopreneur journey is not over in fact it's just getting started feel free to drop a like subscribe and join the journey and let's build valuable experiences and software together I'll see you in the next one",
