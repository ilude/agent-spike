  "raw_transcript": "so have you heard of hugging face I don't mean the alien from the movie I mean the AI company that is committed to open source and I ask that because most Engineers will say Obviously yes I know hugging face and most people who are not Engineers will be like what's hugging face so I wanted to go into a little bit I wanted to explain something that whether you're an engineer or not I think is really interesting from an AI adoption perspective there's a strategic Insight that hugging face has had that nobody else seems to have had so the the heart of what hugging face offers is a Transformers Library it's basically a uh python code package it provides pre-trained models for a really wide range of natural language processing tasks it includes text classification language generation translation summarizing and having that python library has lowered the barrier to entry so developers can fine-tune and deploy models a lot faster and they don't have to build them from scratch and then in addition they have a lot of other things that spin off of that core platform Insight so they have for example uh hugging face spaces with 400,000 different AI apps built on top of it by developers using the platform and now it's easy because it's all in the same platform to just browse through and look at what other people have built uh so fundamentally I think what's interesting about this what what's unusual is that they have figured out how to scale up AI development in a way that's open in a way that's democratized and and no one else is figure this part out yet they've figured out how to get enough developer energy around AI in one place that it actually makes sense to have an AI App Store and that's really what spaces is and I think what's fascinating is that as AI goes faster and faster as more and more models come out this is just feeding the hugging face business model fundamentally hugging face does better when it's a more competitive ecosystem when it's a more uh fast-moving ecosystem when there's more attention on AI I would bet you if there are 400,000 AI apps in the spaces store today which there are and it's not really a store like you could just click on something um it it's it's probably going to be 800,000 by next year like it's crazy how fast this space is growing and I think of that because I can compare it to what happened with chat GPT and their custom gpts custom gpts are much more narrow and limited in what they can do they have to be inside the chat GPT UI you just type and you get a text response of some sort generally speaking I tried the image one that Cana does it doesn't work very well and hugging face because it's just a platform for AI gives you so much more flexibility on what to do and so the models do a whole lot more and that makes spaces much more interesting now I will say it doesn't mean that it's easy to access I know that custom gpts are very very easy and everybody has heard of them because of the power of the chat GPT brand if you're using chat GPT chances are youve heard of custom gpts people are actually using them ironically for like sharing prompts effect ly but if you actually want to do something that is more analogous to a traditional App Store the only option that really has scaled is hugging faces uh spaces feature that's it and I think that's really fascinating that this this opsource platform-driven team has figured out the recipe to get Scaled up Marketplace AI going it's really cool so if if you haven't checked out hugging face I definitely recommend that you do uh if you have check checked out hugging face I would love to know what your favorite app in the spaces uh is I see a lot of interesting ones I'm just curious sort of what has been trending lately it looks like Janice has been doing very well cheers",

    "description": "My site: https://natebjones.com/\nMy links: https://linktr.ee/natebjones\nMy substack: https://natesnewsletter.substack.com/\nSpaces: https://huggingface.co/spaces\n\nTakeaways:\n 1. Transformers Library: Hugging Face\u2019s core offering is a Python package that provides pre-trained models for a variety of natural language processing tasks such as text classification, generation, translation, and summarization, lowering the barrier for developers.\n 2. Hugging Face Spaces: The platform hosts hundreds of thousands of AI apps\u2014essentially an AI app store\u2014that allow users to explore, test, and build on a diverse range of innovative AI projects.\n 3. Open Ecosystem: The company has successfully democratized AI by creating an open, community-driven environment that scales developer energy and fosters rapid innovation.\n 4. Developer Empowerment: By enabling fine-tuning and quick deployment, Hugging Face empowers developers to build sophisticated models without starting from scratch.\n 5. Flexibility Over Custom GPTs: Unlike custom GPTs confined to a single interface, Hugging Face offers extensive flexibility for creating a wide range of AI applications.\n 6. Rapid Growth: The dynamic ecosystem is expanding quickly, with projections that the number of AI apps on Spaces could double in the near future.\n\nQuotes:\n\u201cWe\u2019ve figured out how to harness developer energy in one place to create an AI app store that truly democratizes innovation.\u201d\n\u201cThis platform scales AI development in an open, community-driven ecosystem, making it far more flexible than custom GPTs.\u201d\n\u201cHugging Face\u2019s approach empowers developers to fine-tune and deploy models rapidly, fueling an unprecedented wave of innovation.\u201d\n\nSummary:\nI explored Hugging Face, an innovative AI company committed to open source that is transforming machine learning development. Their Transformers library provides pre-trained models for tasks like text classification, language generation, and translation, which greatly lowers the barrier for developers to fine-tune and deploy models quickly. I was impressed by Hugging Face Spaces, a dynamic marketplace hosting hundreds of thousands of AI apps built by the community. This open ecosystem fosters rapid growth and innovation, offering far more flexibility than custom GPTs confined to a single interface. Hugging Face\u2019s approach democratizes AI and scales up developer energy in fresh ways.\n\nKeywords:\nHugging Face, Transformers library, open source, AI, NLP, fine-tuning, AI app store, Spaces, developer energy, custom GPTs, democratized AI, machine learning, rapid growth, innovation, flexibility, community",
