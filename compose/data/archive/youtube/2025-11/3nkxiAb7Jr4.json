  "raw_transcript": "2025 is starting hot I want to tell you the story of a six-dimensional Mesoamerican deity a broke web developer and a decentralized autonomous crypto organization that somehow has resulted in the number one trending GitHub repo that's right this is the story of ai6 Z so a few weeks ago Shaw who is a real person and who is the web developer here was $100,000 in debt and coding in a tiny apartment with roommates and a stressed out spouse not a good recipe Shaw desperately trying to create something that adds value that helps him to earn something that gets him out of this uh debt situation and perhaps into Better Living circumstances so he starts exploring the Dao Community he hasn't done a lot of it uh he runs into the dow. fun uh community and they make it really easy to create Dows he starts hanging in his first da and he realizes that it is possible to keep content creation going in the da even if one of the creators disappears by aping them with an AI Avatar and so when he's in his da and one of the prominent creators goes missing that's what he does he creates an AI Avatar of the person and they keep creating in the person's style the memes that they're creating Etc match that person's memes well he gets in trouble for this the community does not like this because even though he thought it was an experiment they didn't sign up for it and Dows are really big on community government and making sure that everyone agrees to things so he gets called a scammer and that makes him really frustrated he kind of hits Rock Bottom this is where the six-dimensional Mesoamerican deity comes in because his wife says You seem really stressed you probably need to take some DMT so he does uh and he goes on a little trip and he meets what he describes as a six-dimensional Mesoamerican demon or deity of some sort has a Moment of clarity he comes back and hangs out with the founder of dow. fun for lunch and they start spitballing ideas and he has this sense of clarity that there's really something around AI avatars and crypto and he says what if we do something where we actually clone a prominent investor from their publicly available writings and start a DA around that and they do and it's called AI 16z because they're cloning mark andrees p Mara also known as the guy who helped get gosias Maximus off the ground because he helped fund the aibot truth terminal and he's also a prominent venture capitalist he is the leading voice in a16z which is Andre and hor and they take his available writings and they clone him into an AI agent or they're in the process of doing so this is not actually made investment decisions yet so it's not clear how far he's gotten on this journey and so they give it a try they're like look we'll stand this up we'll call it AI 16z will disclaim any association with actual a16z for legal reasons and I mean I don't know how this all works legally this seems like it's quite a but they're going to disclaim all Association they're going to launch it and see what happens and their goal was I think to get 250,000 uh dollars in there uh in sort of tokens the community contributes have a little fund have the AI agent manage it well it blows past their expectations I think they hit their goal in 25 minutes and then they just go on from there and now the fund is at $2 billion he's obviously paid off his $100,000 in debt hopefully he has a nicer place to live and the the pressure on the fund is now much higher like if this was an experiment two or three weeks ago this is now something where lots of people are betting real money that this AI agent is going to be able to make excellent Venture Capital decisions on the quality on the par with Mark andreon a legendary venture capitalist investor I don't know if they're right my bias would be that they're wrong it's very hard to make good Venture Capital decisions but I think it illustrates a number of the trends that are going on into 2025 really cleanly one Ai and crypto are converging and I think part of why they're converging is crypto gives AI space to innovate at a speed that's faster than traditional financial markets you saw that here there was no sort of blocker they could innovate get a fund set up and get going in a matter of a couple weeks that would never happen with tradition financial instruments I think another theme it underscores is that power is decentralizing this is an ordinary web developer who had a trip in an idea and now is essentially managing a$2 billion investment fund now he's not managing it directly the AI agent is but he's the Creator he's heavily involved he's the one going to China and Hong Kong and soil and other places and that underscores for me how as a leveler and I think we're going to see more stories like that and then I think the third thing that I want to call out is that at the end of the day people are going to try a tremendous number of tasks for AI agents to solve and it remains very unclear where AI agents have true Alpha where they have an edge over humans and solving tasks I don't know you don't know but that's something we're going to find out this year and clearly one of the ones where humans have a huge huge interest in getting this right is Investments we will see but that's the story of AI 16z it's now the number one trending GitHub repo in the world and uh I'm sure that the investment fund size amount is going to continue to grow happy 2025 we started with a bang",

    "description": "about me: https://natebjones.com/\nMy links: https://linktr.ee/natebjones\nMy substack: https://natesnewsletter.substack.com/\n\nai16z: https://cryptobriefing.com/ai-token-solana-market-cap/\nShaw: https://x.com/shawmakesmagic\n\nTakeaways:\n 1. AI and Crypto Converge: AI16z exemplifies the fusion of AI and crypto, leveraging the decentralized nature of blockchain to rapidly innovate and launch projects faster than traditional finance allows.\n 2. Rapid Growth of AI16z: The DAO smashed its initial fundraising goal of $250,000 within 25 minutes, growing to a $2 billion fund in just a few weeks.\n 3. AI-Powered Venture Capital: The core idea behind AI16z is an AI agent managing investments, modeled on venture capitalist Marc Andreessen, using publicly available writings to create a decision-making framework.\n 4. Power Decentralization: Shaw\u2019s story shows how AI is a great equalizer, enabling a broke web developer to create a global phenomenon that rivals traditional venture capital.\n 5. Challenges Ahead for AI Agents: As more tasks are handed to AI agents, questions about where they truly outperform humans remain unanswered, especially in high-stakes domains like venture capital.\n 6. DAO Community Dynamics: DAOs demand community consensus, as seen in the backlash Shaw faced when launching his AI character experiment without proper approval.\n 7. Experimental Space for AI: Crypto provides a regulatory-light environment for AI innovation, allowing experiments like AI16z to flourish without traditional financial barriers.\n\nQuotes:\n\u201cAI and crypto are converging, creating a space where innovation moves faster than ever before.\u201d\n\u201cThis is proof that AI is a leveler\u2014empowering an ordinary developer to create a global phenomenon.\u201d\n\u201cThe real test for AI agents will be finding the tasks where they have true alpha over humans.\u201d\n\nSummary:\nAI16z is a decentralized AI-powered venture fund launched by Shaw, a web developer who used publicly available writings of Marc Andreessen to create an AI agent for investment management. From humble beginnings, Shaw\u2019s project rapidly grew to a $2 billion fund within weeks, making it the #1 trending GitHub repo. AI16z demonstrates how crypto enables AI innovation at unprecedented speeds while decentralizing power. However, challenges remain, including the ethical and practical limitations of AI agents managing complex tasks. AI16z is a compelling case study of how AI and blockchain are reshaping finance and leveling the playing field for creators.\n\nKeywords:\nAI16z, crypto, decentralized finance, DAOs, Marc Andreessen, venture capital, AI agents, blockchain, GitHub, open source, innovation, decentralized governance, rapid growth, investment fund, experimental finance, power decentralization, AI-powered decision-making, community-driven projects, regulatory innovation",
