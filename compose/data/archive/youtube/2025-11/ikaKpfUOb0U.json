  "raw_transcript": "a what do you think is the best use case for large language model technology if you had to pick a single top highest return on investment use case for llms what would you pick that's a great question Dan I think one of the top use cases for large language model technology is customer support automation by integrating llms into chat systems businesses can provide 247 support handle a massive volume of inquiries and improve response times all while reducing costs it enhances customer experience and allows human agents to focus on more complex issues what do you think those voice is kind of cringey I love it and I also hate it yeah I think that's a great use case definitely one of the more obvious ones my favorite though is probably education and learning large language models give us unprecedented abilities to learn at incredible rates that's an excellent point Dan education is such a transformative area for llms they can personalize learning experiences provide instant feedback and create interactive tutoring sessions it really empowers students students to learn at their own pace what specific aspects of education do you think benefit the most from llms okay that sounds good let's uh switch gears I want to ask you about uh programming languages what do you think is the best programming language for rapid prototyping I want to get something shipped out yesterday for rapid prototyping Pyon is often considered one of the best programming languages it's easy to read has a vast array of libraries and supports quick iteration you can build and test ideas very quickly voice another great option is Javascript especially for web applications as it allows for fast development and immediate results in the browser what type of project are you looking to Prototype all right love your answer there let's switch gears once again I want to know what your thoughts are here between Google anthropic and open AI who will win the AI race specifically around llms that's an intriguing question Dan each of those companies brings unique strengths to the table Google has vast resources and data which can enhance their models anthropic focuses on safety and Alignment in AI which is becoming increasingly important open AI has made significant strides in accessibility and collaboration with their apis it's hard to say who will win as the landscape is so Dynamic each could lead in different areas do you have a favorite among them or a specific angle you're curious about here is a Ultra fast personal AI assistant powered by Gro 11 labs and GPT 40 mini voice assisted work is a massively untapped superpower that can super charge productiv up until now building a personal AI assistant just hasn't been viable it's too slow and the voices have been subpar this has changed and we can see that open AI chat gbt with the advanced voice mode is absolutely leading the way in this video though I want to show you how you can build your own personal AI assistant and have full control so you can escape the Walled Garden that companies like open aai and Apple and Google are slowly starting to set up for us as they build out their own Suite of AI products as software Engineers personal AI assistants are too valuable to hand off to a company we need to control at least some of this technology to boost our personal productivity in this video we're going to look at three personal AI assistants I want to show you the fastest and highest quality speech to text large language model and text to speech tooling you can use to build your own personal AI assistant literally today you just heard the gro 11 Labs combination with our amazing Super cringy Voice leave a thumbs up and a comment if you enjoyed that voice we're going to look at a pure open AI implementation and then lastly we're going to look at assembly Ai and 11 Labs we'll then discuss the three key components that make up a functioning personal AI assistant you can see here I've broken this down into this reusable class we'll break these down in just a moment then I want to show you my personal AI assistant prompt that I use to create really concise helpful use ful conversations with my personal AI assistants we'll wrap it all up we'll look at all the stats between our personal AI assistants and see who is the fastest what personal AI assistant combination gets us results in the shortest amount of time I'm going to update the assistant type here we're going to use the pure open aai implementation and let's go ahead and kick this off and ask a few questions Ada in our previous video we looked at the best format for prompts it seems like large language models prefer XML format why do you think that is that's an interesting observation Dan XML is structured and allows for Clear hierarchy and organization of data which can be really beneficial for large language models it helps them parse information more easily than plain text making it simpler to understand the relationships between different pieces of information what do you think about using XML going forward in our projects yeah that sounds great I think my idea is for smaller products for smaller tools I'll use markdown just because it's super readable but for anything we productionize we'll use XML that sounds like a solid plan markdown is definitely userfriendly and quick for smaller tools using XML for production makes sense because of its structure and Clarity do you have specific projects in mind for each format yeah definitely but uh I want to change gears here I want to ask you a question about who do you think is going to win the large language model race between open Ai and Google that's a Hot Topic both open aai and Google have impressive cap abilities but they each have their strengths open AI is really focused on refining user interactions and safety while Google has vast resources and data access it could go either way depending on advancements in research and user adoption what do you think do you lean toward one company over the other yeah okay so hot topic definitely not going to dig into that one at all so this is great so we have some more results and let me just show you exactly how I'm benchmarking this every assistant type is getting its own timetable saved here you can see all the previous results we'll sum these up at the end this is duration in seconds so this works bottom to top so the zeroth position is the newest item inside of our action list here it starts with transcription this takes open AI 1.7 seconds to transcribe our audio it then takes the text from our audio and runs a prompt and you know we can see that here we'll cover our personal AI assistant prompt in just a moment here so thinks uses an llm to return a response we're using gp40 mini for highp Speed high performance that takes about 1.6 seconds and then lastly this seems to be the longest step we need to then convert its response into voice so this is our generate voice audio step and this takes about 3.7 seconds for open AI to run the great thing about the open AI personal AI assistant is that it runs everything with a single API key if you open up the sample here all you need to run the open AI system is just the open AI key but this is what the timetable looks like you can see we have our Gro timetable here we'll go ahead and sum them at the end but let's go ahead and discuss the key pieces of every personal AI assistant so the first step is the transcription step you first speak to your computer you record audio and that's what we saw in the first step here right the first thing that happens is we press enter get a recording and then we hit enter again to stop the recording the next step is the think step so this is giving your response and giving a prompt how do you want your llm to actually respond that's step two the final step is speak so giving the response from the think step you need your assistant to actually say something this is really important because the speak step also entails what voice you're using and how fast that runs with these three steps you can recreate your own personal AI assistant with any tool if we look at our last tool here we can dig in and look at how exactly this is all running so first we're running transcription here we're using assembly AI they have some really nice simple tooling that allows us to just pass in a file path this is our recorded audio file and then we just grab the text from that right so now we have our transcribed text then we have our think step right so this is where we're literally just passing our prompt to our llm with our text embedded and let's go ahead and take a look at this prompt I'm passing in some information here I'm giving my assistant a name you then give your assistant your name and then you write whatever instructions and rules you want your personal AI system to follow maybe you like more detailed responses I prefer the short conversational concise responses I like to use single prompts here versus the chat history messages so I like to pass in our previous interactions and then our latest input so the latest thing that I have said and then we end with a nice leading command your conversational response this leads the LM in the right direction so it knows exactly how to start responding feel free to jump in here tweak this to your liking this is probably one of the most essential prompts as it kind of creates the tone and the structure that your personal AI assistant responds with when conversing with you so that's the think step and then lastly we have the speak step I like to break this into the generate voice audio because I don't need to time how long it takes to actually play the audio all I want to know is how long did it take to generate the audio here we're using 11 Labs V2 in our grock personal AI assistant we're using the 11 Labs turbo v2.5 model which is supposed to be 25% faster so that's the framework all this code is going to be in the description for you to get started with your own personal AI assistant imagine an AI assistant that knows your data your work style and responds in a blink of an eye that's the future we're heading toward you can see this with open AI chat GPT advanced voice mode it's all heading in that direction I just want to make sure that you and I have our own version that we can operate on that isn't inside of a Walled Garden closed Source company if this framework makes sense and you can see where this is going hit the sub hit the like and let's continue to our next step here so you can see in our model setup here we're using the build mini model and we're doing this in every single one of our assistants we're just running the build mini model and that's going to return an llm model that is the gpg 40 mini this is the best way way to get the highest performance with the highest speed at the lowest cost this is a different way to interact with your computer we've been chatting with our computer we've been typing it's time to start talking to your computer and taking things to the next level so let's go ahead and fire off the last assistant type here this is a combination between assembly Ai and 11 labs and if we go ahead and split the screen here we can see the results come in at the same time so I'll go ahead run this split the screen and then I'll load that file as soon as it comes up so let's go ahead and just ask another random question here what's up aah do you think that Society shapes technology or does technology shape Society be concise be short here all right so we should have that file here we're going to see this file pop up there it is hey Dan that's a great question I think it's a bit of both Society sets the needs and values that drive technology while technology also influences how we live and interact it's a dynamic relationship what do you think yeah I think that's spoton they both affect each other in this kind of in this kind of circular endless pattern there you go absolutely so you can see the new results coming at the top feack Loop where each one evolves based on the other do you see any recent examples of this interplay in your daily life let's switch gears Ada I want to know your opinion on the effect that personal AI assistant will have on us Switching gears sounds great Dan I think personal AI assistance will significantly enhance our daily lives by improving efficiency and accessibility they can help us manage tasks provide information quickly and even assist with personal growth however it's important to consider privacy and Reliance on technology what aspects of personal AI assistance Intrigue you the most all right so we have some more data out of the assembly AI plus 11 laps combination you can see the times coming in here so it took 2.7 seconds to generate voice audio it took GPT 40 mini 1.5 seconds to think um it looks like transcribe step though is coming in pretty slow from assembly AI when you're working with your personal AI assistant you want things to be fast you want results quickly and you want to be able to jump in and out of work as if you were just typing right let's go ahead and open this up and let's see what our results look like overall so now we have concrete responses from our open AI results from our grock 11 Labs combination and our assembly AI 11 Labs combo so I think I want four numbers here from each one of these I have cursor open right now so I'm just going to select everything and just run a quick prompt using Claud 3.5 to get this done summarize the duration for each function add a new row at the bottom with the totals for each function just going to let that rip let it do the work here great cool so those numbers look correct just doing a quick prompt check uh add the total duration of all steps just doing some quick fun prompting work here looks like the total time it took to run three interactions back and forth using assembly Ai and 11 Labs took about 30 seconds okay so not too bad not too great either let's go ahead and move on let's go ahe and do open AI next and I'll just run the same thing sum the duration for each function bottom and then I'll just give it an example example so let's go ahead and let that rip cool so that looks great it looks like our Pure open AI personal AI assistant took about 19 seconds so that's really really great right compared to our previous AI assistant that's about 10 seconds faster and you can see here our transcribe is faster and our generate audio is just a bit faster you'll notice here the think is the same as I mentioned all of these models are using the the GPT 40 mini for their think step let's go ahead and finish off strong with the gro 11 Labs combination and this 11 Labs is using the 11 turbo 2.5 model for the text to speech run that same prompt I'll just hit up drop that example in and fire off so we're just letting our coding assistant here do the hard work for us okay well this is actually really really close so if we just quickly look through the results to make sure that these numbers look good 2.8 2.5 three yeah that looks right okay so I mean the results are in we can just pull these in to a new file here and it is you know as expected open AI coming in at first place assembly AI in 11 Labs a far third place this is largely assembly ai's fault very slow to be fair I'm on the free version of assembly AI they might have faster speech to text functionality on their upgraded plans that's likely to be the case so pretty interesting results I was pretty confident that Gro would come in first place here but it looks like open AI stack is really really great of course the disadvantage is 11 Labs gives you a ton and ton of customizable voices you can work with open AI only has a few voices to play with they only have you know six voices and you know the quality is you know not ideal but also not terrible whereas 11 Labs has an entire Suite of voices for you to pick from and they're all pretty great at a high level this code is going to do the following on a loop press enter to start recording this is going to pick up audio from our microphone when we press enter again it's going to capture that recording we're going to run our personal AI assistant transcribe step we're going to let our personal AI assistant think with our prompt and then given the response of the prompt it's going to speak the response we'll delete the audio and then we'll update our previous interactions which is basically just our chat history and then it will just continue to run the in a loop all this code is going to be in the description for you to check out and get your own personal AI assistant up and running today I recommend starting out with the open AI assistant it seems to be the fastest and also the easiest to set up the disadvantage there is that you're limited to their six or seven voices that they provide so you can see here based on our assistant type we're running a different assistant and our assistant just runs the exact same commands right we have the setup call we have the transcribe step we have the think step and then we have the speak step it really is that simple these are the three essential methods of a personal AI assistant so these are the results of a conversation of length nine we have a pure open AI personal AI assistant in the lead we then have Gro and 11 labs in second place and then in a distant third we have assembly Ai and 11 labs and it looks like the big loser here is assembly AI my personal AI assistant combination will likely be open AI plus 11 Labs I'll likely combine these two specifically because we get the bonus of having customizable voices and that completely changes the pseudo digital relationship that you have with your digital AI assistant so that's it for this video I wanted to share this so that you're aware that you know you can build and use your own powerful personal AI assistant right now definitely leave a comment and let me know if you're using any one of these Technologies for your own voice assisted work I think personal AI assistants are going to be a massive massive game Cher for engineers looking to push their productivity to the very limits thanks so much for watching and I'll see you in the next one",
