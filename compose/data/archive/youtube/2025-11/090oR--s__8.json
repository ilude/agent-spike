  "raw_transcript": "this is a video where it's better to show not tell we'll discuss how powerful AI assistance can be for your engineering especially in 2025 after the demo while you're watching this feel free to comment and share what capabilities you would want your engineering personal AI assistant to have hey adah hey Dan how can I help you today a to go ahead and scrape to a file from my [Music] clipboard the content has been successfully scraped and saved to the file structured outputs introduction guide. MD is there anything else you would like to do with this file AA can you go ahead and update the structured outputs introduction guide file let's go ahead and clean it up remove some of the formatting we have some lists of numbers that don't need to be there let's just clean it up and focus on the use case of structured outputs and the code examples surrounding it use a reasoning model for this [Music] the structured outputs introduction guide has been cleaned up and revised with a focus on the use case of structured outputs and relevant code examples the reasoning model was used for this task ni J ad go ahead and load that file into our active memory [Music] the structured outputs introduction guide file has been loaded into our active memory how can I assist you further nice job beta go ahead and use the structured outputs introduction guide as an example and let's create a new python file with examples on how exactly to use structured outputs go ahead and create a new file a new python file for us with runable code use your reasoning model for this [Music] the python file structured outputs examples. py has been created with examples on how to use structured outputs feel free to check it out and run the code all right a can you go ahead and run that code for us go ahead and run python on that file [Music] the code in structured outputs examples. py has been run successfully would you like to see the output no that's okay I have it right here I can see the output here in this file thank you you're welcome if you need any more help just let me a to go ahead and scrape to a file from my clipboard go ahead and take this URL scrape it create a markdown document for [Music] us the content from the URL has been scraped and saved to a markdown document named openis swarm overview. MD let me know if you need any further assistance cool yeah let's go ahead and just discuss this file uh just briefly tell me what this is all about what is open AI [Music] swarm the file outlines open AI swarm which is an experimental educational framework for multi-agent orchestration it showcases concepts for coordinating and executing agents primarily using the chat completions API open AI swarm is designed for educational purposes rather than production allowing developers to explore lightweight scalable and customizable agent patterns and functions okay can you walk me through a couple use cases of this let's just keep discussing our open AI swarm overview document what are some use cases of this and how does it differ from other multi-agent [Music] tools open AI swarm is designed to help developers learn about multi-agent orchestration through an educational approach it emphasizes lightweight ergonomic agent orchestration with a focus on handoffs and routines some use cases for open AI swarm you developers can use it to understand and experiment with multi-agent systems Dynamics without the complexities of a full production environment it is useful for developers to explore different agent coordination and execution patterns open AI swarm differs from other multi-agent tools in the following ways experimental and educational it is built for exploration and learning rather than for deployment in a production environment statelessness unlike some established tools with stateful capabilities swarm maintains statelessness between interactions focusing on handoffs and routines overall open AI swarm serves as a learning tool for developers to grasp the essentials of multi-agent systems without the overhead of more complex production focused platforms a to go ahead and delete the open AI swarm overview file Force delete and then after that go ahead and clear our active memory go ahead and reset our active memory uh Force [Music] delete the open AI swarm overview file has been deleted and the active memory has been reset if you need further assistance feel free to let me know you to go ahead and scrape to a file from my [Music] clipboard the content has been scraped from your clipboard and save to the file openai API pricing guide. MD in the scratch Pad wonderful can you go ahead and update that document and just simplify it a lot um I just want a clear breakdown of pricing just single headers and then the pricing of every single model right below that super blunt simple bullet points break down the pricing for me go ahead and use a state-ofthe-art model for [Music] this let's update the open AI API pricing guide markdown file and uh at the top of the file can you go ahead and add a CSV table with the model name the input pricing and then the output pricing and then can you also just add a um estimated average token pricing as a uh final column go ahead and use the state-of-the-art model for this [Music] hey to go ahead and create a new empty CSV file call it model [Music] pricing the empty CSV file named model pricing. ccsv has been created wonderful Ada can you go ahead and update the model pricing file I've updated it with model prices just go ahead and get rid of the quotes for us and make sure that it's all snake case for our column [Music] headers nice Joba thank you you're welcome Dan if you need anything else just let me know all right so I hope you can kind of see where things are going with the power of AI assistance when it comes down to it AI assistance are going to accelerate our information rate what does that mean exactly I think at its very core software engineering is about processing and manipulating information and then Building Systems that allow us to do it at scale the combination of these incredible reasoning models with the new real-time API that gives us speech to speech capabilities is insane for engineering we were able to work through three use cases for personal AI assistance for software engineering in particular and I think that there are plenty plenty more we use about a quarter or a half of our tool set here and uh you know we were able to do a decent amount of work without uh typing a single character so I think that's really important I think this is really powerful and there's an interesting pattern for building AI assistance that I want to share with you here you saw me pull in data into active memory this is basically a simple Json file that probably should be built out into a full database but the idea here is simple as you're working with your AI assistant do you want content to be loaded directly into active memory so that we can use it throughout other prompts just real quick to dip in the code a little bit you can see here that we are constantly loading in the memory content for instance in our create file call when we're actually generating new files we're going to load the existing memory content from our active memory. Json file into an XML block right so this gets fully loaded into the prompt when we're creating brand new files so this is an interesting pattern that I think is going to be important on top of personalization where we'll be able to customize our personal AI assistance I think this pattern of having an active memory kind of like a ram Random Access Memory I think this pattern is going to be really important moving forward and over time we're going to want our personal AI assistant to automatically manage their own memory as the conversation is going on right and this is all on top of the um historical memory that is built up on top of the real-time API content right and that's probably a good next step to take for the personal AI assistant is to onload so for instance in the the main file here when we first load our assistant we're going to want to be able to right away load our active memory into our assistant immediately I think this is a massively important Trend to pay attention to as software Engineers this code base is going to be in the description for you if you want to check out this next version of the realtime AI assistant I feel like I'm probably 10 tools away from having a really complete Ultra useful software engineering focused AI assistant that I can use in parallel that can work in parallel with me while I'm building out software and getting things done I can feel this tooling I can feel the culmination of all these incredible AI tools changing the way I build changing the way I think about building this is all really incredible technology I hope you can see where this is going we're speaking in natural language to direct and control our personal AI assistant that can delegate work to a slew of specialized AI agents we scraped content we brand code we generated a demo we generated a proof of concept we discussed a repository and then we did some content reformatting to be totally clear a lot of the stuff you can do by hand on your own I think that's really really clear we're Engineers we can move really quickly on the keyboard but the advantage here I think of having a personal AI assistant with a focus in engineering is to run tasks in parallel to you and get work done in parallel to you by just running a couple commands and by firing off a few Tools in natural language we can have a personal AI assistant get work done with us in parallel I think when you combine that with the powerful reasoning agents we can really set up high quality long running agentic workflows that again are working in parallel with us as we move forward with our day-to-day tasks the future is here it's just not equally distributed yet and to be fair the tooling is still getting there but we get to see it first together here on the channel by building it stay focused and keep building I'll see you in the next one",
