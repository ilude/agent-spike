  "raw_transcript": "as an engineer nothing is more important than your ability to learn the pace of software is like no other Tech tools come and go by the week pipe Cycles bring in the next programming language and companies lift up their favorite homegrown Tech over others that's why learning and learning how to learn is at the core of every great engineer's toolbox as the channel grows we're starting to get some video requests we recently had a viewer request a video on Pi testing let's up level this and talk about the fisherman's prompt instead of diving into pie testing let's dive into how we can learn anything with modern AI Tech open up chat GPT open up your favorite text editor grab the prompt from the description paste that in this is the fisherman's prompt with this prompt and the combination of llm Technology specifically Chachi BT and gpt4 you can essentially learn anything let's walk through this I am a your level profession and I want to learn topic so I can objective all the rules below to generate a comprehensive yet concise mini course for Rapid learning the course should contain chapters that teach me about these subtopics so here we go we have another capitalized reference here make sure the chapters fit my level profession and topic ask for clarification if you need more information about my knowledge and then we have two references here the subtopics and then the rules so now that we have the fisherman's prompt let's go ahead and take this prompt fill in the templates and then we're going to fill in the references as well so I'm going to say I'm a senior engineer I want to learn Pi testing so I can write safer full code follow these rules and then we're going to fill in the subtopic fundamentals faster testing Advanced testing okay so awesome so I'm going to take this prompt I'm going to go into chat gbt dump it in and let's learn about Pi testing so awesome so right away you can see it's breaking into chapter one which is the fundamentals of Pi test it's giving me an intro it's asking why use Pi test and one of my favorite Parts about the fisherman's prompt it's giving me real world use cases right imagine you're building an API you want to ensure every endpoint Returns the expected response and then it's giving concrete examples if you notice here in the rules this is where all the magic happens right we have this capitalized reference to the rules section and it's saying use concrete examples use emojis to add Expressions generate one chapter at a time ask for feedback at the end as for clarification if each concept give a real world use case and then we have a when everything's complete it's going to give us an additional list for us to explore so if you've never used bike tests we basically have functions and then we have tests for our functions and then you can run this podcast command on your file that has your tests in it this is also it keeps breaking down the real world use cases now we're diving into another sub module here fixtures so remember at the end of every chapter it's going to ask for feedback and clarification so let's ask about fixtures let's say that fixtures don't make sense I need more details please explain Pi test fixtures awesome so it's generating a new sub chapter and it's just calling it you know a deeper dive into Pi test fixtures if you're not familiar with fixtures it's essentially a way of creating abstract components of your test that you can reuse throughout your test life cycle so what does that actually mean you can create variables with this syntax using the podcast fixture decorator and then you can pass it in as a parameter in any one of your tests just using the name of the function and you had now have it available you can use it to provide mock data to ensure consistency across tests and reduce the need for hard-coded values right and then it gets into the scope of fixtures which is really cool so the scope basically just specifies when the test fixture resets so yeah some more details here on fixtures so this is really great so let's say that you know I want to dive even deeper so I'm just going to ask what is the at Pi test fixture tax and as you can see here we're breaking down what exactly this podcast fixture syntax is just as some of you may know this is a feature called you know decorators or basically you can wrap functions in other functions so you know create things like higher order components but the fixture is essentially this right you have a function that contains a function and inside of the nested function you wrap whatever functionality you want to run around the original function and then you can say you know my decorator death say hello world so you know you can dive into this more if you need to using this prompt there's tons of documentation on both decorators and the patches fixture let's go ahead and move on to our next chapter let's move on to the next chapter and just like that we're jumping into the second chapter so I just want to highlight like how cool this is that GPT chat GPT and other llms are giving us this ability to basically learn anything as long as we ask the right question right as long as we provide the right prompt and the fisherman's prompt does that exactly for you and there's tons of variants of this prompt but this has been one of my favorites as I was kind of like looking through what I wanted to do for this video I ended up going down a rabbit hole of using the fisherman's prompt to learn some uh you know functionality that I wasn't aware of so in chapter two right chapter two we asked it to be about faster testing so how can we write tests faster how can we speed up our tests and it's you know offering a couple different ideas here Pi test X discs where you can run your tests in parallel based on the number of CPU cores that you have it's very cool we have podcast test mod which allows us to rerun tests that have been changed or updated very cool we have Pi test cash these are like brand new tools I haven't heard of these and you know we can just look these up these aren't hallucinations they're legitimate test Frameworks that can be used so awesome so that's chapter two let's go ahead and just move on to chapter three which is Advanced testing awesome so chapter three Advanced testing with pi test perfect I was hoping it was going to talk about parameterized testing this is awesome instead of writing multiple tests podcasts allows you to parameterize a single test function so you can see here with parameterization we have two input values and then an expected value one two three and we're just doing a simple addition test but with parameterization we can walk through three different types of tests that we want to run with three different variable sets right so this is really cool I use this feature all the time all right so we have a pi test mock feature very cool this is also really awesome you can use Mark to group your tests together so that you can run specific groups of tests exclusively with podcast Dash M and then you specify the mark so we have slow and this will run all the tests that have this Pi test.mark.slow specify let's say uh you know I need some more clarification right so you know you're using this as an active learning tool the fisherman's prompt is a really fantastic way to accelerate your learning so it's all about asking the right questions it's all about digging in one of the great Parts about Ai and AI tutors and AI teaching and you know prompting is that there's no one here to to judge you uh you know and that sounds like a silly thing but it really matters right like when you get into different work situations when you get you know around certain groups like there's an inherent expectation that you know something or that you're up to some level it's not really conducive to creating an environment where everyone can learn and everyone can get up to the same pace and Beyond AI tutors are really really going to be an incredible tool in that way and I think what AR tutors really are is just a really great prompt and it backed by really great llm so let's go ahead and dig into this a little bit more right I want to learn more about task parameterization right because I think this is a really cool feature teach me more about test parameterization this seems really useful I think the chat based interface really shines when it comes to learning and when it comes to accelerating your engineering because oftentimes you have you know tons of questions about what you're learning and the great part about this prompt is that if we hop back undo all the changes that we made it's extremely versatile right like you can replace this with anything you can say I'm a you know beginner back an engineer and I want to learn rust so I can expand my skill set and build uh performant safe back-end Services right then you can break it down into subtopics which will become your chapters right so it's a pretty versatile prompt while being very minimal let's see what it's teaching us about test parameterization here you can see here more examples we have a b and then expected so we add a and b and then equals expected very cool now this I did not even know combining multiple parameterizations so looks like we can stack these and so it passes in A and B and that runs them with the combination of all variables see this is really cool like I I didn't know you could do this we can add IDs for test inputs I see so this adds descriptions during the test output that's really cool wow we can use this indirect flag specify a variable that will be computationally expensive so even like me sitting here you know working through this prompt creating this video I'm actively learning here this is just a really fantastic tool after we complete every subtopic present a list of additional topics so I'm just going to go ahead and be more explicit and just ask what other topics can we explore awesome so these are these are really great suggestions test driven development code coverage tools cicd right this is a major one whenever you push your code whenever you merge it you can have all your tests run to ensure code quality and it can be completely automated static code analysis integration testing it's already got all the domain knowledge you just need to ask the right questions and then dive in whenever you you want to learn this is really cool Behavior driven Development I've never heard of this so after you prompt this list you can then continue just diving in right so let's just push this one more time let's say teach me about cicd with GitHub actions right and you can just keep going down this Rabbit Hole of Rapid learning before you would have to read through tons of documentation read through tons of guides now with llm technology which igbt gpt4 all you need is the right prompt The Prompt is in the description grab this use this please save yourself time if you enjoy it drop a like drop a sub you can just use this to just keep pushing your knowledge you can keep pushing what you understand what you can do right so this is incredible so it's walking us through a concrete example of setting up a basic GitHub actions workflow where we run our PI tests incredible stuff so it's all here guys it's all here all you have to do is reach out ask the right questions again grab the prompt if you have something new that you want to learn and it's within the GPT time frame I think it got boosted up from September 2021. I just want to highlight this idea one more time software engineering is really about change it's about using the best technology you have available to you and that means that you have to be constantly learning and you know constantly keeping up with new technology and updates to existing technology right software is is like a river it's always evolving and it's always changing shape of the landscape around it right you want to be riding the river you want to be looking around you want to be observing and picking things up and this prompt the fisherman's prompt can help you accomplish that stay sharp keep learning if you found this video useful if you you know agree that staying sharp is valuable and you understand that concept and that principle join the journey as we filter out through the hype and focus on valuable tools valuable techniques that help us build better safer stable software as quickly as we can huge thanks to everyone who's been showing love to the channel the past couple of months we've been taking off like a rocket ship so I really appreciate all the support like sub and I'll see you in the next video",
