  "raw_transcript": "three real use cases of AI that I think are interesting right now one is in spying one is in nuclear power and one is in drugs so we'll start with a spying first Boston based startup Goos spy had a public facing website for a while where you could upload any Street Corner type photo anything that's at street level and it would immediately identify where it was taken in the world this reminds me of the uh guy known as rainbolt online who would look at any photo and immediately geog guess where it was well AI could do that too and AI did do that and that's what GEOS spy is all about and there are obviously privacy implications here because you can imagine taking picture of you and your friends like suddenly like it could be uploaded everyone would know exactly where you were Etc geosy closed their public facing portal after some public objections and is now marketing the product only to law enforcement it will certainly get youed number two on the drug side deise hassabis is the 2024 Nobel Prize winner and has already won a Nobel for AI I don't I don't know if you know that but like he won for AI for Alpha fold 2 which is a protune folder he founded a startup after winning the Nobel and the startup is called isomorphic labs and all it does is it focuses on drug Discovery and what he is saying is that in his opinion drug Discovery is going to go from a decade long process to weeks or months with AI and the first AI designed drugs from his lab are going into clinical trials the next couple of months so if you are wondering like is AI actually making a practical difference yeah we're moving to clinical trials much faster than we used to and that's going to speed up so that's really exciting number three on the nuclear side uh Commonwealth Fusion which is a little spin out of MIT uh MIT produces these research driven spin all the time uh they're working on stabilizing Plasma in tokumx for nuclear fusion uh through Ai and so I'll explain what that is a tokomak is little Hollow tube it has magnets in it it contains the plasma the plasma is very hot for nuclear fusion if the plasma touches the container it's going to melt it you don't want it to do that it's also very unstable and so what they're trying to do is figure out how to predict future states of plasma in the nuclear fusion Reactor with artificial intelligence so that they can better manage the magnet power array to contain the plasma and sustain the reaction for longer so that's exciting because nuclear fusion is one of those Technologies that's been about 20 years away for the last 60 years uh and so maybe something like that will actually help us to get to a point where it's more commercially viable we'll see speaking of fusion this is a weird one uh and it goes to how you have to sort of be thoughtful about what you see AI doing online uh there's a Canadian streamer who claims that he built nuclear fusion on his kitchen tabletop talking only to Claude in 36 hours nobody can figure out if he's telling the truth or not he streamed the whole thing but no one can figure out if what what we saw at the end was actually nuclear fusion or not so I I think one of the things that's interesting with AI is that it does give us these uh increased capability sets but we also don't really know where the edges are because this is all so new and so this is an example of something where we aren't sure is it possible because you use CLA to do this or not you tell me what are some interesting use cases of AI that I haven't heard about yet or haven't mentioned here yet I'd be curious to hear more cheers",

    "description": "My site: https://natebjones.com/\nMy links: https://linktr.ee/natebjones\nMy substack: https://natesnewsletter.substack.com/\nNuclear: https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnwerner/2025/01/18/private-sector-advances-nuclear-fusion-with-ai--new-plant-to-open-soon/\nDrug discovery: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-21/deepmind-expects-clinical-trials-for-ai-designed-drugs-this-year\nGeoSpy: https://www.404media.co/the-powerful-ai-tool-that-cops-or-stalkers-can-use-to-geolocate-photos-in-seconds/\n\nTakeaways:\n 1. AI for Spying: GeoSpy developed an AI tool to identify locations from street-level photos instantly. While initially public, it shifted to law enforcement use after privacy concerns.\n 2. AI-Driven Medicine: Demis Hassabis\u2019 Isomorphic Labs uses AI to drastically reduce drug discovery timelines from years to months, with the first AI-designed medicines entering clinical trials.\n 3. AI in Nuclear Fusion: Commonwealth Fusion leverages AI to stabilize plasma in tokamak reactors, a critical step toward commercially viable nuclear fusion energy.\n 4. Fusion Breakthrough Claim: A Canadian streamer claimed to achieve tabletop nuclear fusion in 36 hours using Claude AI, sparking debate over its authenticity.\n 5. Uncharted AI Boundaries: AI expands capabilities, but its limitations and ethical implications remain uncertain, as seen in fusion and location-tracking applications.\n\nQuotes:\n\u201cGeoSpy\u2019s AI tool shows how powerful and controversial location identification has become.\u201d\n\u201cAI is transforming medicine, cutting development time from years to months with drugs already entering trials.\u201d\n\u201cWith AI stabilizing plasma, nuclear fusion might finally be within reach after decades of promises.\u201d\n\nSummary:\nAI is reshaping industries, from spying and medicine to nuclear power. GeoSpy\u2019s location-identifying AI tool transitioned to law enforcement due to privacy concerns. Demis Hassabis\u2019 Isomorphic Labs is revolutionizing medicine by reducing drug discovery timelines, with AI-designed drugs entering trials soon. Commonwealth Fusion is using AI to stabilize plasma in nuclear reactors, a major step toward sustainable energy. Meanwhile, a streamer\u2019s claim of achieving tabletop nuclear fusion using Claude AI highlights both the potential and uncertainty of AI\u2019s boundaries. These advancements show AI\u2019s transformative impact but also underscore its ethical and practical challenges.\n\nKeywords:\nGeoSpy, AI spying, Isomorphic Labs, AI medicine, Demis Hassabis, AlphaFold 2, Commonwealth Fusion, tokamak reactors, nuclear fusion, AI plasma stabilization, Claude AI, AI ethical implications, privacy concerns, AI drug discovery, AI boundaries, technology innovation.",
