  "raw_transcript": "what's up Engineers it's Andy Deb Dan here and I've got a different type of video for you today this is going to be a special video where we are AI coding a zero noise minimal agentic information dieting tool I'll be commenting over this AI coding session to give you some insights on what I'm thinking and how I'm building this in this tool we basically provide a list of URLs we're interested in then it lets you know if there are any in updates based on the last scene date you can see here we're looking at cursors change log and the last updated post was you know July 3rd so we can track this with a last scene date and a couple of great llm so you know in this video we're going to be using some of the best AI coding tools we'll be using AER with sonid 3.5 we're going to be prompting almost every line of code and we're going to build out a tool to help us filter through the noise to kind of focus on the content that we really care about content that will help us make better decisions as product Builders and as Engineers so if that interests you definitely stick around and let's go ahead and get started so right now you can see I'm just walking through some of the previous scraping functionality just to make sure that it works make sure that it lines up with the actual documentation here the actual content you can see that that looks good we built some of this scraping functionality out in our previous couple videos we're kind of on a series of building out these different agentic workflows I want to not just talk about this technology I want to show you exactly how you can be building valuable technology with these tools so right now I'm just going through the scraped content I already have a little bit of code set up here uh reusing it from our previous video where we built out a a gentic Blog that automatically updates so you can see there we're kicking off AER with claw 3.5 Sonet and now we're going to add a couple items to our context one of my favorite things about AER is that you just add items to the context Point Blank and now AER uses all of that content for its prompts so here's a useful AI code prompting technique you can use you can see at the beginning of that prompt there I say update main py colon main colon and then I start detailing out the changes I like to call this context chaining and it really allows you to be more specific with where exactly you want your change and uh you know the more code you have the more effective context chaining is because it allows your llm to really know exactly what you mean and where you want to changes to happen we're going to be using streamlit for the UI here and we are reusing our agentic workflow framework structure so you know we have the retrieve step we have the agentic step act learn notify and uh again check out the previous video I'm going to link the previous couple videos that lead up to this in the description you can see here we have a couple updates here we're going to update the title to zero noise and just do a little bit of tweaking with the streamlet UI now we're going to start adding our providers into the UI so I'm setting up some expanders for each one of the configuration providers in the config.js file you can see the prompt there I just want to highlight the importance of really curating your information stream it really comes down to junk in junk out novel ideas in novel ideas out the more you fine-tune your you know personal knowledge base the more potential you have to make interesting positive Roi decisions and actions and that all comes down to your information stream what are you learning what information are you taking in and based on that information what actions can you take because you knew that information all right with that prompt complete we now have a loop over each provider inside of an expander you can see cursor there and now we can click the URL and we have the last scene date if you look at my tabs I've got Simon Wilson's blog I've got the AER blog these are some of the blogs that I like to pay attention to it's really really important to be plugged in to the tools and the Technologies and the creators the builders the engineers that are really at the edge of a lot of the value that's getting created and this is where the real engineering is happened this is where the real value creation is happening and I think it's really important to be plugged into that so that's really the point of zero noise you know the best Engineers are not circlejerking their celebrations on Twitter to gain attention they write deeply they think deeply and they they execute on this stuff right these are the people that I curate into my information diet and that's what this tool is all about that's what zero noise is all about all right so if you're enjoying this video so far if you're learning something if you find this interesting definitely hit the like hit the sub drop a comment let me know what you like let me know what you don't like definitely let me know if you're interested in more AI Dev log videos like this I think it's really interesting to kind of put this all together for you to show you how I'm writing code in the current age of generator of AI these llms are getting more powerful our tooling is becoming more powerful and the way we code is changing there's there's no question about that right now if you're writing code with AI you have a sizable Advantage but soon there won't be any Engineers left writing code with without AI I want to help you get there I want to help you get caught up with the current state of things and hopefully beyond the current state of things AI coding is here to stay and it's a complete paradigm shift in how code is generated I think that's the new ground truth of the future of engineering all right so right now we're just updating the workflow statements so that we get the right streamlit logs when the identic workflow has completed and I prompted away my right calls in between the workflow functions so I'm just adding those back now with that prompt that ran basically instantly and now you can see each one of those workflows running we need to call st. Ron to trigger the UI to update we're getting to a really interesting point here I'm going to start adding the agentic block of code here and the agentic is where everything really happens so you can see I'm adding additional context to AER uh check out the channel for previous AER videos I'm not going to go into any detail here on how exactly it works but basically I am adding additional context so that AER has it I'm clearing out all my tokens right there just to kind of get a fresh start a fresh reset and then right now I'm writing the prompt that's going to generate um this kind of core workflow so it's going to read the script content from the providers in this case it's going to be the cursor change log and we want our AI coding assistant to you know for each provider in our config.js it's going to scrape the content and it's going to look and see if there are any new updates since my last scene date which we're also storing in that config.js file so you can see there AER is popping off getting all that written for us getting a good first draft of our AG gentics this workflow by the way like I mentioned is an outline of how I'm writing all of my agentic workflows right now we went in detail in this in a previous video I'll go ahead and Link that in a description for you but basically you retrieve all the information you need you then run your agentic this is your prompts your prompt chains your AI agents your assistance apis you then act based on the information and the decisions that your agentic has made you learn so this is you teaching your AI agent anything that it needs to to learn and then lastly um you notify and that's you notifying anyone that needs to be updated uh you know with the the result of your agentic workflow so that's the steps again I'll link that in the description check out that previous video and the video before that we talked about the prompt chain that's this minimal chainable run you can see on line 84 uh we went in detail there but basically we're running prompts back to back that's what's getting passed into that minimal chainable run call in addition to the context you can see we're passing in the scraped content last scene date and the name and we can use all that information in our prompt chain so really powerful one function utility there that I wrote it essentially replaces you know maybe 30% of a agentic llm library I'm certainly getting a ton of value out of it for these sequential agentic workflows so right now I'm doing some prompting on these prompts which is kind of funny to say I'm writing a prompt on prompts to and a i coding assistant so that it can update the prompts um but basically just updating to markdown format so I can create some more structured prompts so that I can you know just really clearly communicate with AER and the underlying llm and more importantly you know make it easier to read for myself and any theoretical other Engineers that would be you know looking at this code reading this tool just a very good pattern I think to use markdown uh you know for your prompts I'll probably have another video coming out on that at some point where we'll discuss the different input types for your prompts you know you can use XML you can use markdown like we are here and you can use no format uh you know there are different ways to structure your prompts I've also seen some Json prompts that look pretty good but I think the clear winter for me right now has been marked down prompts just a great structure to write in you can separate sections it's easy to add context it's easy to add static variables and dynamic variables okay so this is really the Crux of most agentic workflows right it's what are you telling your agents to do how do they collect information how do they Drive information so I'm using a prompt chain with two prompts and we're out the Json format we're setting up a specific response format in the Json structure we're looking for that Json to respond with a bing if it has changes we want a summary of the changes or null if there are no changes and then we want to get the date of the changes and of course the date of the changes is going to allow us to track the date in which the the change log or the blog or whatever the resource is it's going to allow us to track when it was changed we can then store that and use it for subsequent runs you can see there I just use a prompt to create a new type based on the Json format inside of a prompt this is a big shout out to aer's multifile capabilities um and also you know Sonet 3.5 is just the top tier model right now uh getting some really impressive results out of that specifically with AI coding of course in other domains as well but it's just been so great for AI coding so you can see I'm parsing that last result coming out of the prompt chain results minus one is going to give me the last result we're parsing that because that should be Json and then we're looking to see if for this information stream if we have new content we want to uh you know log that we want to update our configuration and so again in the previous video you you can kind of learn more about the logging system but I'm formatting these changes here this is the result that came out of that last agentic run and you can see here we detected new changes coming out of cursor and you can see here these are the prompts that were filled in I like to call these context filled prompts not in size so we're not talking about the context window type field but you know variable context filled in there you can see the scrape summary was passed in from the last prompt chain and and uh yeah I remember at this point I needed to clean up that text it's not exactly how I wanted that to come out there so I just deleted that and um you know added a kind of nice simple continuation for Sonic 3.5 to kick off the summary of the changes in Json format there um that is a really really nice part about uh these claw models specifically again 3.5 5 you don't have to pass in any signal like you don't have to pass in a bing saying you want Chas on you just ask for it in your prompt which makes it really really seamless so we're making some good progress here right now we're updating the configuration items that get parsed from the Json file we're kind of piggybacking up that type so that we can add you know some information to say say okay if something did change what changed and then we're also just adding a bing to the information items to say you know if it's true then something did change so just walking do that right now made a typo here as you can see I'm setting the parse results to the parse results so I come in here and add this just make sure that I'm setting the provider values there we go provider update summary and update date are getting set to the parse result out of the the end of The Prompt chain checking our token usage right now running about two cents a prompt I think it's worth it it really depends on how much your time is worth but you know to write this code this fast um I think it's well worth you know usually I'm paying about one sent a prompt yeah I'm just going to go ahead and add the change detected right into the configuration item here and make sure that that gets set so basically we're writing a prompt to say you know update the title of each configuration item to show if we have a change detected so if our llm detected a change we want to see that visually in the UI so just writing the prompt for that we can see AER and Sonet 3.5 blazing through that change and so now you can see there's a little sleepy Emoji next to cursor there and if there are updates detected we'll see that update to a star but uh I have a little bug here that we're going to solve in a second here I haven't actually set changes detected coming out of the prompt chain so you can see here I just opened the terminal real quick and just started writing that prompt AER I don't even have to look at the code because you know I know exactly what's there and I know that AER will detect it and write it for me so you can see on that that additional search after the prompt chain ran that got filled in and I was able to just search up to the agentic function so just making a couple more tweaks here all right so so now we're kicking off this workflow and this is where it's really going to come together that kicked off and it did detect an update so you can see here update summary it's giving us a quick summary it's telling us when it updated it's showing the last scene date and then we can just you know of course go in and click into the information stream the blog the change log whatever your url is you can just click into it it and get updated so now we're going to write the ACT function of our gentic workflow and the ACT method here is going to basically update our config last scen date based on the result so we need to Loop through all of our providers and update that if there's a change detected as I mentioned earlier you'll notice my prompting pattern here I'm saying update and then usually it's a file name or a class and then colon and then the specific function of course this gives your llm a lot more context allows it to focus and it prevents it from getting confused with any other code that you have and you know when you're writing a small project like this you're just getting started that's a lot less likely to happen when you're running your AI coding assistant on a larger file you know it's a lot easier for your coding assistant to get confused and for it to think you want something but you actually want something else so we now have the update logic thanks to the ACT function and we're just going to give it a run here there we go so we got changes because our last scene date is before the date that is on the resource URL so you can see that the the new updated date is now the 4th instead of the 1st of July and now if I run that workflow again the ACT function has updated that last scene date in our config and cursor should come up blank here yep so we get our sleeping Emoji there and there are no changes detected right and so this is really the power of zero noise this kind of small large language model tool and we're going to go ahead and just test to make sure that it's legit we're going to add AER we're going to look at the your blog and it's got a nice date for us to look at there I definitely should note that you know there are other ways to detect if changes exist um you could easily create a hash of the content and you know do a a simple hash diff but at some point you're going to want your AG gentics to you know summarize a content to let you know if there's something detailed that's changed so that you can you know really decide if you want to click all the way into it so right now we're adding the AER provider item using a prompt this is another you know AI coding prompt technique where we're just basically generating some Json from a prompt and of course you can infer the context and just like that got generated so this scales really well you can see just after refresh we added that Json item and it's just good to go so now running this for both cursor and AER and you know with this all we have to do is you know every morning or on whatever schedule you want you wake up you hit around workflow you see if there's any new changes to the resources that you care about and if you're interested in the changes you can go ahead and click into it otherwise you save a ton of time you're not constantly opening up these resources you can see here we're getting a great breakdown of what was changed on the AER page since June 1st to July 2nd and you know if you're interested in the changes you can hop into them you can click on the URL otherwise the Json will automatically update with the newest date and on the next run the following morning it won't pick up any new changes this is a great way to have information pushed to you in a zero noise fashion the there are new interesting changes or they're not and you can add as many URLs this is kind of just a proof of concept I wanted to put together thought it would be cool to make a video on this you can see we have the respective prompts and prompt results for AER and cursor this entire coding session took about 35 minutes and now we have a reusable agentic information filter we can now filter in and out content and we can easily add additional blogs I'm definitely going to be adding Simon w and a couple of the other really key information streams I really like to focus in on if you made it to the end you're an absolute Champion thanks so much for watching stay focused keep building and I'll see you in the next one",
