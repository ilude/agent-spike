  "raw_transcript": "My inbox is littered with people pitching me AI agents. If I go online, I see nothing but AI agents. It's the year of the AI agent, and I have yet to find an AI agent that really made a difference in my workday until today. Comet is that AI agent. And the reason why is not AI, it's UI, it's user interface. And I'm going to get into why that is and kind of show off Comet a little bit. at the end of the day is an agent that works because the team at Perplexity has figured out that my goal is to actually let the assistant do the work and disappear. It is not to see everything the assistant does. It is not to get buried in the cost of building the assistant. And so many agents right now bury you in the cost of building the assistant or controlling it directly. Let me give you a few examples. Zapier and NA very different generation. Zapier is a much older company. and it ends much newer. Both of them lean you into building an agent. You have to define exactly what you want it to do. You have to invest really, really heavily in getting it to work right. N8 is soaring in popularity because it is better at that. It does offer value. Don't hear me wrong, but it is not a general purpose agent. It's not close to a general purpose agent. And if you try to build a general purpose agent in NA, you're probably going to be disappointed. It is useful for specific agentic tasks. If you want to do a specific job that involves extracting text from a document and putting it into a spreadsheet, for example, Naiden will do fine at that. You can probably get Zapier to do fine at that. There are a lot of other agent startups that will do that, too. But Comet is different. Comet by Perplexity is really a generalurpose agent assistant. The closest comparison we've had previously has been Operator from OpenAI and Project Mariner, which most people don't know about from Gemini. Look, I wanted to love Operator. I really did. operator. The vision was great. Chad GPT on the web, the power of Chad GPT decisioning across the web. The execution and the UI were really, really bad. They just were, I'm not going to sugarcoat it. It is awkward to have this tiny little browser that looks like a toy-sized browser inside a chat window. It's slow. Like, I don't care what the actual clock time says on these Asian things. I think it starts the clock late or something because I swear it takes longer than it says it takes. I've had instances where operator says it took eight minutes and it was like 20 minutes of clock time. And so if you think about it, the vision for operator was great, but what doomed it was the UI. It was the UI. And what Perplexity gets right is the UI. That's why Comet shines. Comet shines because the fundamental inside of the Perplexity team is that the assistant should disappear. They should just go do work for you. I was on a different website today. I was actually looking at Substack cuz of course I was and I was just like crap I have a meeting I have to reschedule it and so I just worked with Perplexity to get the meeting rescheduled. I talked to my common assistant and I said hey this is the meeting approximately here is where I want it moved. There's a block of meetings here. Suggest a time. It went it found the meeting. It suggested the time. It actually gave me a recommendation for a better time within that block that would fit well with my goal of like clean working blocks. And then it drafted up um a calendar change. I made a minor edit and approved it. And then it said, \"Hey, just as a best practice, you should send an email to this person, too.\" And I said, \"Okay, great. I'll send an email.\" I drafted up the email and I made another minor tweak and approved it and sent it all from the sidebar while I was doing other things. I didn't have to go to Gmail. I didn't have to go to Gcal. It was super easy. LinkedIn. I was able to go through and look at my pending LinkedIn invites sitting in the sidebar chatting with Comet. Super super easy. What I'm saying is that the idea that we have to see the agent is probably a legacy of the idea that the agent is untrustworthy. And if the agent can hook into data and it just works, we don't need to supervise it as closely and we kind of don't want to. We want it to be fast and trustworthy and dependable. And I will say comet gets this stuff done quickly. It gets it done really well. I am a fan, as you might expect, of Indonesian cuisine. It found for me an Indonesian restaurant that I had not run across in my neighborhood. Well, not quite my neighborhood, two or three neighborhoods over, but still, it found something in a special interest of mine in my city that I wouldn't have been able to find otherwise. So, I'm getting real value on day one, and it's been really easy. I also think when Comet needs to interact with your browser and starts to take over, the way they've done that UI is really good. What Comet does is it actually goes to your main browser and glows it up blue like you're like looking through a Star Trek portal or something and then it like does something quickly in the browser and then like it takes the blue away. It's a very intuitive way of saying, \"Hey, Comet is driving now. You always have a chance to stop it.\" It's just really smoothly implemented. You're probably tired of hearing me talk about Comet. So, let's very quickly show you Comet. Okay, here we are. Tik Tok shop is slowing down. That is I literally put that into the address bar here. It's triggers a perplexity search. It talks about the impact of how Tik Tok shop is slowing down. I have a thesis that I want to explore with assistant and we're just going to watch Assistant work. Okay, I have a thesis that Tik Tok shop slowing down affects social commerce more broadly and may impact Amazon's outlook. Please look at Amazon's recent public info filings, etc. Get a sense of how the company is looking at social commerce. And you can see it's just working away there. Now if I want to continue, I can also continue here. I can say has Tik Tok experienced layoffs around Tik Tok shop right this is happening simultaneously. So Amazon's produ pursuing an agnostic social commerce approach explicitly response to Tik Tok. uh similar integrations with Instagram, Snap, Pinterest, and YouTube Shorts. Growing a bunch of other initiatives to keep up with creatives. So, I'm getting a sense of how Amazon's approaching this, and I really appreciate this is actually a more coherent take than I typically see from AI at this point. It's it's not just bland like Amazon is not ignoring tech stock slowdown. It's hedging risk and investing further. That seems to be supported by the comment up there. And it's also more actionable and on point than I've typically seen. Uh and yes, this has affected Tik Tok shop. So, it seems like we have a Tik Tok shop impact. All right, let's just do something fun. Can you find the uh top profiles on LinkedIn for Tik Tok shop affiliated PMs and engineers who may have been affected by layoffs and it's going to go and like look at my LinkedIn. So what what I'm trying to give you a sense of is how this can look across multiple things. It plugs into LinkedIn. It plugs into your calendar. It plugs into your Gmail. You can do multiple things at once. This is going to keep running even if I change where I'm going up here in the address bar and then it starts to find them and I don't know like I'm not going to go and click on their links. I don't want to violate their privacy. But like it gives me both a way to approach it and some example profiles. Overall it's pretty good. So there you go. That's Comet. I have been really pleased with it. I think that Comet is the first agentic browser that actually lives up to the name. And I think whether it's worth $200 a month essentially requires you to add up those 5, 8, 10, 15 minute increments that it's going to be saving you and be disciplined about it, measure the value of your time and say, is this worth $200 a month in time savings to me? And that's a new way of valuing software. But I think that's where we're at with cognitive uh intelligence baked into software at this point. It gives us a new valuation paradigm for software that I'm still getting used to myself. I'm not used to paying $200 a month for any kind of software, let alone for a browser. Old Nate is crying. I don't know why I'm doing this. But it makes sense when you think about the time savings. If this thing saves me 10 15 hours a month, it's obviously worth the $200. And if you add up all those 10 15 minute increments saved through the day, I can see the case for 10 hours a month in savings and that would make it worth it. So I think my challenge to you if you want to start to explore good agents is to ask yourself to impose the kinds of tests you would actually use them for. Be really rigorously honest with whether they work or not. Like I put Comet through eight different workflow tests this morning just to see how good it is before making this video. I was not easily impressed. I wanted to examine it and I wanted to examine it versus operator because operator is a tool I know pretty well and been frankly disappointed in. If you want to try Comet, I would suggest signing up for it for just a month and putting it through workflow test in your own environment with the tools you use and see if you get value and measure the value. Measure the time savings. If you're going to make an investment like this, make sure you make it worth it. Because if it is worth it, if it saves you more than 200 bucks a month, it's going to be probably a multiple of that. Like, if it's saving you 10 hours and you value your time at $35 an hour, you're getting close to 2x ROI every single month. If you value your time more highly, you get more. If you save more time, you get more. You see where the math goes. And that doesn't count it helping you make better decisions. And because it can look at the browser natively, it can help you make better decisions in a way that like screenshotting doesn't really do. And so there's another sort of hard to measure aspect where there's something native about the collaboration between the assistant and the browser that you can't get any other place cleanly. And I think that's another piece of value that perplexity is positioned to capture. Now the key if you're perplexity is that you are making an OS, right? This is where all of these AI players are going. We live on the web so much that if you become the browser, the dominant browser of choice, you become the OS for AI. And that's where they're going. Time will tell if this actually pays off. If Google launches Mariner more aggressively because Google obviously has a stake in the ground with Chrome. Maybe Open AI is going to lean away from voice a little bit and lean farther into operator. Who knows? One thing we know about AI is that it's going to change frequently. But for now, what I know is that I actually saw a general purpose agent that work today. And I'm still amazed. I never expected to see a general purpose agent that was this fast, this efficient, this effective across a wide range of tasks, flight reservations, restaurants, looking at LinkedIn tasks, looking at Gmail tasks, looking at calendar tasks, looking across multiple different sources to accomplish workflows. It's doing a lot. And I can see that the team has built a data structure that's going to enable them to do even more. To me, this feels ahead of schedule. Yes, I knew agents were coming, obviously. Yes, I knew general purpose agents are coming. This fast and this connected feels three or four months early. So, it's great to see it. And we'll see sort of where the Perplexian Comet team takes us next. Let me know if you get comment what you think of",

    "description": "My site: https://natebjones.com\nMy substack: https://natesnewsletter.substack.com/\nThe Story : https://open.substack.com/pub/natesnewsletter/p/i-threw-my-real-workday-at-two-ai?r=1z4sm5&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&showWelcomeOnShare=true\n\nTakeaways:\n 1. UI, Not AI: Comet\u2019s breakthrough is a friction-free interface that lets the assistant disappear and simply get the job done, instead of forcing users to micromanage agent steps.\n 2. True General-Purpose Agent: Unlike task builders such as Zapier or n8n, Comet juggles email, calendar, LinkedIn, research, and web actions in one fluent workflow.\n 3. Operator\u2019s UX Cautionary Tale: OpenAI\u2019s Operator shows that even powerful models fail if wrapped in a toy-sized, sluggish browser\u2014bad UX kills adoption.\n 4. ROI by Time-Saved Math: At $200/month, Comet\u2019s value hinges on adding up the 10-15-minute slices it saves; ten hours saved at $35/hour already doubles the spend.\n 5. Browser-as-OS Strategy: By owning the browsing layer and \u201cglowing\u201d the page blue while it works, Perplexity positions Comet as the operating system for web-based AI.\n 6. Months Ahead of Schedule: Comet\u2019s speed, reliability, and data hookups arrived three-to-four months sooner than expected, delivering the first general-purpose agent that feels production-ready.\n\nQuotes:\n\u201cWe want the assistant to do the work and disappear.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not AI, it\u2019s UI\u2014that\u2019s why Comet shines.\u201d\n\u201cI actually saw a general-purpose agent that worked today.\u201d\n\nSummary:\nI\u2019ve spent months testing AI \u201cagents,\u201d but none impacted my day until Perplexity\u2019s Comet. The magic isn\u2019t the model; it\u2019s the interface. Comet slips into the background, handles calendar reshuffles, email drafts, LinkedIn triage, even local restaurant searches, all without making me babysit it. Operator and other tools bury you in tiny toy browsers or flow builders, proving that bad UX kills great tech. At $200 a month the only question is whether its 10-15-minute micro-saves add up to more than the cost. For me, the speed, reliability and browser-level integration finally deliver a general-purpose agent worth paying for today.\n\nKeywords:\nComet, Perplexity, AI agent, general-purpose assistant, user interface, Operator, Mariner, Zapier, n8n, time savings, ROI, browser OS, calendar integration, Gmail, LinkedIn, agentic workflow, $200/month, social commerce, TikTok Shop, Amazon strategy",
