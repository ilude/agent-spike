  "raw_transcript": "what's up guys i'm back today i want to figure out what the hype is all about with graphql this is going to be the first episode of a new series where i dive into new technologies and see if there's value there of course this is always my personal opinion um obviously there's value there because tons of people are using it i've only looked at the website i've heard of graphql i have seen examples of it in the wild but i've never actually touched it myself and that's going to be i think kind of the fun of this type of video is that you're going to be watching me dive into a new technology for the first time so it's a really raw take um you know i think it'll be really interesting to see how it goes nothing is so i haven't prepared anything and um yeah so you can you'll you'll be able to get you know a really raw take of uh you know me a senior level engineer diving into a new technology and seeing what it's all about so let's see if graphql is hyper not okay so first things first what does graphql do you love a good landing page that actually tells you what it does and here this is kind of making sense uh you describe the data ask for what you want and you get the results okay so already my first thought is isn't that just what an api is already i mean it's nice you can specify exactly what field you want but can't you just customize your api is that the advantage here you get to say exactly what you want okay get many resources with a single request craftkill apis get all the data your app needs in a single request oh so i could hit multiple could i hit multiple apis in a single request i guess that's literally what they just said um oh nice yeah so okay so that that that seems to be the advantage right you have access to full capabilities from your data from a single data point okay uses types to ensure apps only ask for what's possible and provide clear and helpful errors okay so that makes sense that makes sense um okay okay so we have some tools we can update the apis without versions what okay that's interesting i wonder how that actually gets pulled off in practice you just add a deprecated field okay bring your own data and code okay of course everyone's using graphql okay i'm convinced let's get started um we're gonna do javascript obviously okay so yeah so you can see here i have this uh empty directory here nothing's happened um and uh let's get a basic example going so do i need a client and a server or wait how does this work what do i need to have set up and what are all these libraries these are just examples using different libraries that's kind of a lot okay um so this is just setting up the server client oh okay server client tools okay so i just want to set up a basic example right so let me just try this let me just get this set up here so um how do we do this yarn in it sure sure sure sure sure sure sure um then let's do yarn add craf ql okay and then let's do a code here great now let's add this index.js and i'm just going to copy this all in and hop to the package i don't know if this is gonna suffice but uh we will see uh we've got copilot given me not great suggestions here let's just add a dev how do i run this up node okay so we just used node okay so let's see what happens here okay so what just happened i don't know if this is the best example it's super raw so what's going on here uh we've got graphql we've got build schema so the schema makes sense right the schema is is there like uh simple explanation for all these things yeah let me actually read the docs right read the docs man stop skipping um it's one of my biggest faults as an engineer i'll just skip the docs i just want to dive in then providing functions for each field on each type what you're joking right graphql servers is created by defining types and fields on those types then providing functions for each field on the type why would i ever do that what okay then we have this query oh type query yeah let me change this so this makes sense to me so we have user id and name and we'll do like email right so now how does this change so this is this is the function i assume that um gives back some arbitrary value and so now i assume i change this to id and then i need functions for all the other fields that's what this object is doing so name this is my name email gmail.com and now what the f is source is this the query is that what this is like what is source yeah queries mutations okay simplest graphql is about asking for specific fields on objects so is this is is this source just all the fields i'm asking for so if i said id name and then i ran this now i get an error query root must be provided what does that mean let me just go back in time here so it's just hello query root must be provided is that saying i need this user no even modify a basic example not good not good so what does that mean let's just dig in here okay is there just some way i can let me just go back let's just slow it down right let me just change this to id oh maybe it just doesn't like the id name no it just doesn't like this at all wait what did i change if i put everything back it actually what did i change isn't this the original example that was query how how how does that make any sense type query what i thought that was creating my own type what type query okay so far so far not a good start not a good start here um that doesn't make any sense i changed type query and then everything bombs so i wonder if i keep tough query the same and i just add a field id string will this work okay i imagine it will right okay so that's good at least um let me json stringify this um what i don't understand is this top level query thing i thought that was me defining my own type um and relating it to like a specific model but let me just keep reading i love looking up cheat sheets wait this is exactly what i mean type query type user what so what is this error exactly query root type must be defined i guess you just need this for some reason let me just try to create another type here i just want to understand like the basics right so like look at the user just string name whatever and so how does this work then how do i how do i uh how do i add additional types here you know like how does it know how do i specify yeah how do i specify additional types this doesn't make sense right the schema we have the query mutation subscription that all makes sense i still don't understand this like query why is this special i'm going to go ahead and say the docs here are not good it's not immediately clear what exactly is happening and how i can modify basic example by going to the introductory example so i guess i just keep reading okay so i am looking at this tutorials point example and it's making a bit more sense there's some auto magic going on here but what i am beginning to understand is that the query is the top level object in which all additional queries happen um all additional like schema definitions happen so everything happens there i think so for instance like my query would consist of you know users you know like this um so basically it creates this giant object graph yeah i don't know i i'm still working on this let's see okay so i have added so i'm looking at this example in tutorials point it's being a lot more helpful than the actual docs which isn't great um you know surely there's a better way to present and show how to change things on graphql but whatever um and i've added this make executable schema i've added a new type and the root value object the resolver let me change this to resolver because that's the official terminology um resolvers actually uh but we'll just call it resolver for now so um so i have this information in here right we have a function for each type so now i'm going to try to just add user in here and i think this is i think this is wrong we just say that right away so i think i'm doing this wrong but let me just try this and then let me try to this is called source really seems like an awful name should be called a query um but i'm going to try this and then i want to look at user id i think this will bomb no that worked okay let me just change that value to make sure that um i know what's happening and i do not know what's happening what is going on i'm looking for user colon id and i'm getting query id what okay so this cannot be found so i i think i think what's supposed to happen here is i have user inside of query and then i can look like this right so then i can do you know yeah exactly then there's a user in here and we go down and then we delete this so the query i think acts as like the true root but that doesn't really make sense why why couldn't you have multiple root objects i don't know um so let me try querying now user no so that's still an error right great aliases operations variables how do i just modify a basic example man like you know there are two types that are special within a schema every graphql service has a query type and may or may not have a mutation type these types are the same as regular object type but they are special because they define the entry point of every graphql query why is this buried so deep in the documentation shouldn't this be like the first thing you say you know i don't know then what is this like where did the query go isn't the query supposed to be the top level i don't know and how are you how are you operating without your query root like what is happening is this is this is this doing this magic where it's assuming query is right here you know what i mean like is this query really you know what i mean that is exactly what's happening it's hidden it's hiding this it's so annoying this documentation man by coming into so i know nothing about graphql right coming into this this is awful like this is an awful experience they magically are hiding this query field everywhere um okay okay okay so now we have now we're nesting so how do i how do i do this how do i do this right i'm i'm legit just trying to query what do i just do user did you mean user oh i'm not doing this right it's just this oh okay there's an aha moment so i was basically right i just had the syntax wrong okay all right all right all right guys i freaked out a little bit whatever it happens learning new technology you know okay great so that makes sense so but this is just a list right so what if this was or i'm sorry this is just an object what if this was a list so let me bump this and let me change this i assume the syntax is like this magical right now what happens so now i get back to list i get back the complete list of every item here so let me create another one just to prove this out uh jane doe whatever and then let me um i was gonna do something else here i was gonna format my json because it looks like here there okay so that makes sense so now i understand graphql um i was missing i had an extra colon here and that threw everything up let me actually see how good that uh error message looked line one column ten one two three four five six seven eight nine ten yeah i don't know i feel like this would be a common mistake can i just look for colons and say remove the colon whatever close result okay so 45 minutes in um and i have finally added a new field i added a new type i nested the type and it started to make a little more sense so everything is under this query object wish they said that in the docs more clearly right up front um do people like when you're when you're developing i'm curious like drop a comment down below when you're writing coding you're learning a new technology do you read through all the documentation before you write a line i don't know about you guys i don't do that i start with the basic example they give and then i try to fidget with it and experiment with it um but based on where this information was it's as if i was supposed to read all the docs first you know and i think that that's a sign of bad docs if you have to read all the docs to write to run like a basic example the docs are bad the docs are bad um so but that's just me that's me i could be wrong here how do i pass so so next thing how do how do i pass arguments into my resolvers right and then i can pass an argument in here i'm going to pass one error of course i have an error um supposed to be a string expected name found string what are all these i assume these are the function arguments here just like i'm just going to print out all these args dot dot args right i don't know let's just run it yep what do you know so where the f where do they say that this is how this works you know i don't know and like is this the query are these the queries or is this the resolver like is this javascript like what is where is execution dude i am not a fan of these docs this is i'm just like piecing this together the one that was passed then down here oh graphql graphql man oh i i'm gonna write i think i'm gonna write like a how-to guide on this these talks frankly there's trash these stocks are trash only their first example makes sense as soon as you start diving into this what's happening honestly honestly not to like flames i know engineers are doing hard work usually but what what what are these docs am i supposed to hit learn more and i'm gonna have to edit the crap out of this video because there's so much blank time of me just going oh this is this is why we get paid the big bucks right to suffer and reach docks it's it's all good though who cares um okay so this is making sense uh let's just keep reading um now i can set this structure up for my users i can change this into a full function exactly yeah i'm going to filter by the arg id and then we're going to come in here set up an id field for the user and you know i'm gonna i'm assuming let me just rerun this i'm assuming that these arguments are optional unless i place the bang next to it is that true it is true yeah so r is coming in empty there so so if so then i should wrap this in an if statement right so let me just change this or fetched users i guess just keep it simple and then fetch users filter only if exactly only if we have the args id will we query down on that and then i can do since i magically just know graphql now i can do id so let's just look at that user database not the fine i made a bug always make bugs didn't update the name this is why you always use replace now run great now i get all my users with the id and now i'm going to fetch just one user by passing in uh the id field that's kind of weird um on the id it should probably be like filter id let me change this filter id because that naming is like not cool what is this yeah dot filter id uh let me run this so let me update this to filter id well first let me just run i guess great so that works and now let me pass in filter id and this equals i just want to get jane doe here all right so we get jane doe and then let me add uh the name so i know it's her um the argument filter id on user oh i put it on the user so let me jump up a level okay uh five four three five four oh yep let me update all my fields of course and now no one matches that why is that is this r coming in no the arc is coming in for sure right yeah um oh fetched user this is actually a function uh fetch user id as a function it's kind of odd wait why am i doing that now playing mapped items because the resolver just needed to return some value before yeah that makes sense in my head user id is not a function yes i know because i just changed that okay great great all right so one hour in uh i can modify and boost this up one hour in i can i i see the schema i see the resolver i see the magic i see the query right it's making sense and of course we're gonna have types it is a great feeling when you're working with new technology and you're starting to get it you're starting to get the picture um so to me it's it seems like graphql like i'm trying to think like you always compare right everything is only good relative to something else graphql is good because it gives you one way to fetch and modify every set every piece of data in your database or your storage unit whatever it gives you one it gives you a single interface to fetch and modify all of your data yeah up until now here's that magic bs up until now we have using shorthand syntax where we omit both query keyword and query name but in production apps it's very useful to make your code less ambiguous why do you start with that why don't you start with that and then never say it you know beats me so that means i can add query here okay yeah let's look at this input type because we're not just querying data we're also modifying it and instead of query i'll have i don't know generator okay so now i have this i'm going to pull the fetched user's object out so that i can modify its state and then it'll stay alive then i can run multiple uh graphql fetches all right so i can do the query should turn this into a function but whatever this is q one mutation one result this is q two and then inside this mutation um can i just spread the args oh here we go new user there we go that's the right way to do this and i'll return the new user but i'll also add it to fetched users all right let's see how we did okay let me turn the filter off on the query so i can just grab the new users okay what's happening expected dollar sign found id or sorry what i don't understand is the mutation so it looks like the mutation is i also specify what i want to get back after it's modified okay can i just not specify that field create user of type user what do you mean of type user what let's have a selection of subfields is that this okay why why do i have to re receive a result aren't i mutating that's because i said i would can i just say void or some here is there a void keyword why why do you want a result after you update or after you write i guess to get the latest solution install an entire library no so it looks like the answer is no not by default you can define a you can define a return type which is nullable oh all right let me just run my final example and then wrap up here uh i think i've had enough graphql for one day specifically graphql documentation for one day great so as we we can see here when i run this command i'm getting my query for my first fetch here and then i'm running my mutation i'm creating a new user and then i am running a second query to see if my users were updated and they were great because i pushed the new result here so let's do a quick recap of what we've learned here so you have your schema this is where you define a specific query type which is where you specify all of the primitives and objects that can be queried this is where you specify your mutation type which specifies uh specific functions that modifies your data and then you can create a bunch of auxiliary types that basically uh map to your models and your schema defines how all of your models can be written and read to and from your back end that's what the schema does the resolver maps your queries and mutations from your schema and it allows you to fetch information from your databases to read and write to run crud on your databases based on the structure you created in your schema that's what resolvers do and then we have operations i don't know if they refer to that um yeah operations that's looks like the right way to define this yeah operation type is either query mutation or subscription great so the operations are how from your front end you'll call your uh queries mutations and later subscriptions and get the subscriptions here um so your operations is how you request and write to to your backend from your front end right and in my example i'm just keeping it all localized here in a single node file and then you build your graphql object your schema and then you run your server or your whatever your back end is and then your client can then hit it there are different plugins uh different packages that you can use to um you know set up your back and then your front end and uh map everything out and that is my rough take of graphql my thoughts the real value in graphql seems to be in creating a single endpoint and a single structure in which your apis can be queried to me it looks like your graphql layer can replace all your apis or they can be placed right in front of your apis if you already have you know api like legacy code or existing code um i need to play with this some more i can i can see the value right because the value is that you have a single interface for writing and reading to all of your apis there seems to be a decent amount of boilerplate certainly a learning curve or maybe a documentation curve i'm not a fan clearly of the [Music] graphql documentation but i after two hours here have the you know the value add of graphql um i am going to create more content around graphql i know it's a super relevant piece of technology right now i need to give it some time to settle in because really these docs really threw me off um but also that's just learning something new right it's you know there's always that initial challenge so hey whatever yeah so that's been fql i'm going to create more graphql content i need to dig in more and understand this and i'll create more content around it as well but uh yeah thank you for watching i'll see you guys in the next one [Music]
