  "raw_transcript": "this one is all about voice uh we're going to start with apple apple has apparently decided that they are not going to be producing a new version of Siri that is based on a smart large language model until at least 2027 so more than two years away at this point most likely which means Siri is going to keep waking up when you don't want it to Siri is going to keep falling farther and farther behind advanced voice agents there is something about voice that seems to work with smaller builders that just doesn't work with the large companies Apple clearly is having trouble shipping a new version of Siri Amazon finally shipped Alexa plus but they're powering it with Claude so it's a voice mode but it's powered by a large language model built by a smaller independent uh model maker and now we have Sesame if you haven't heard sesame.com it's a new research uh and de velopment shop it's focused on building a personable AI companion what they've really focused on is the vocal inflections that humans perceive as human which means that talking to it feels like talking to a person it is so Eerie that people are having really strong reactions to it positive and negative uh when I've been talking to it my brain can't help but think it's human like it fools my brain at a subconscious level like I can tell myself this is a large language model that's fine but my brain doesn't buy it my brain is interacting with it like it's human because it sounds so human it pauses it will have the like little disregulation in speech that we humans have like uh or taking a breath or thinking about it yes this can take a breath isn't that weird so if you haven't had a chance try it they are scaling fast they're getting a lot of attention when I checked them 10 minutes ago they were scaling so fast they couldn't pick up my call otherwise I would have done a live demo here with Maya um but yeah have a look at them I'm sure they'll be back up later today and I think that the thing that I am taking away from all of this is that voice is hard voice seems to work better built by small labs like Sesame or like 11 Labs but voice is also highly valuable and so we should look for mergers and Acquisitions in this space we should look for more Partnerships like Amazon snap up sort of Claude as a partnership that they can work with for Alexa plus uh at the end of the day the big companies like Amazon like Google like Facebook they have distribution they have massive distribution and they can actually scale these voice Services whereas the little lab seem to be good at actually making voice services that work well it's funny I see a similar pattern with image generation as well where you have small companies like mid Journey doing really well with stable diffusion um other small companies working on video and large language model companies seem to be a bit different they may the best one still may be sort of independent companies for now like open AI or anthropic but at the end of the day they require a lot more Capital versus The Voice models or the image models and so they become larger faster anthropic just raised three and a half billion on a Series E I think yesterday so part of part of what I've been pondering is that the culture of innovation that we're seeing in this cycle for Tech is following some of the similar patterns we've seen in previous Cycles where smaller more Nimble companies that are startups are disrupting through technology and larger companies are effectively having to partner with or purchase that Innovation and we see that with voice we see that with large language models Etc so check out Sesame it's fun and uh Sesame apparently remembers what you say for two weeks so have a conversation come back have another conversation and uh see what happens cheers",

    "description": "My site: https://natebjones.com/\nMy links: https://linktr.ee/natebjones\nMy substack: https://natesnewsletter.substack.com/\n\nTakeaways\n 1. Apple\u2019s Siri Delay: Apple is reportedly not planning to release a new, smart LLM-powered Siri until at least 2027, leaving it lagging behind more advanced voice assistants.\n 2. Small Labs Lead in Voice AI: Independent companies like Sesame and 11 Labs are advancing voice AI, while larger corporations struggle to innovate in the space.\n 3. Amazon\u2019s Voice Strategy: Amazon\u2019s Alexa Plus is powered by Anthropic\u2019s Claude, highlighting a trend where big companies rely on smaller AI labs for cutting-edge technology.\n 4. Sesame\u2019s Hyper-Realistic AI: Sesame\u2019s AI is so human-like in speech patterns and vocal inflection that it can subconsciously trick users into feeling like they\u2019re speaking to a real person.\n 5. Mergers and Acquisitions on the Horizon: The gap between innovation and distribution suggests that major tech companies will continue acquiring or partnering with voice AI startups.\n 6. Parallel Trends in AI Development: Small, nimble companies are driving breakthroughs in voice and image generation, mirroring historical innovation cycles where startups disrupt and larger firms consolidate.\n 7. Memory and Personalization in AI: Sesame remembers conversations for two weeks, indicating a shift toward AI systems that offer deeper, context-aware interactions.\n\nQuotes\n\n\u201cWe should look for mergers and acquisitions in this space\u2014big companies need the distribution, but small companies are the ones making voice AI actually work.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy brain is interacting with it like it\u2019s human because it sounds so human. It pauses, it breathes\u2014it even hesitates like a person.\u201d\n\n\u201cVoice is hard, but it\u2019s also highly valuable, and the companies that crack it first will have an enormous advantage in AI-driven interaction.\u201d\n\nSummary\n\nApple is delaying a major Siri upgrade until at least 2027, leaving an opening for smaller voice AI innovators. Independent labs like Sesame and 11 Labs are making rapid progress in realistic AI speech, while larger companies like Amazon are relying on external partnerships\u2014Alexa Plus now runs on Anthropic\u2019s Claude. Sesame, a new AI lab, is pushing the boundaries of voice realism to the point where users unconsciously interact with it as if it were human. The voice AI market is ripe for acquisitions, as startups create superior technology while tech giants have the distribution power to scale it.\n\nKeywords\n\nApple, Siri, voice AI, Alexa Plus, Claude, Anthropic, Sesame AI, AI assistants, natural voice AI, AI innovation, AI acquisitions, voice recognition, conversational AI, startup innovation, large language models, AI personalization, AI speech synthesis.",
