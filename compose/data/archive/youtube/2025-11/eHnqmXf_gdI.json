  "raw_transcript": "so a few days ago open A's 03 model did very well in a coding challenge I think it's now ranked top 50 in the world anyway they release their paper showing how they did it and the interesting thing is that the way they trained the model is not specific to coding it was a generalized 03 model that did very well and they called out that the reinforcement learning that they used to make a model generally good at coding so it could accomplish a particular code Force challenge is something that could be applied in other business contexts basically anywhere in business or in other spheres in life where you could actually have a true or false response to a model either the model got the answer right or the model got the answer wrong you had the opportunity through this reinforcement learning technique to make the model more effective and so if you think about reinforcement learning as a way of giving structure and verifiable rewards for business tasks this paper from openi unlocks a lot of other pieces for example you could look at Investment Portfolio optimization that might not seem like it's binary but you can very clearly tell when something is a correct portfolio versus a portfolio that is under optimized or under Diversified sales funnel optimization and Lead scoring you can clearly tell when a lead is scored incorrectly or not and you can measured over time by deal propensity to close in financial forecasting or in loan underwriting you can see if the loan goes bad or not and you can see if the underwriting was correct or not and then you can start to optimize accordingly over time supply chain Logistics you can look at kpis like routing warehousing inventory replenishment and see if you made the optimal decision add bidding optimization and marketing similarly basically anywhere in business where you can say this was done correctly or this was done incorrectly reinforcement learning can enable you to build a model or train a model or F tuna model so that you can effectively use AI to accomplish that task and I'm not saying that you should take that and go out tomorrow and find tuna model and it will be as good as 03 is but I am saying if you look ahead six months if you look at where models are going think of these domains as being domain means that models can learn quickly and that they are likely to learn quickly as they become more intelligent in other words what open ai's paper showed is the areas in business where models can do useful work and are likely to start doing useful work in the near term and I think that's a really important Insight cheers",

    "description": "My site: https://natebjones.com/\nMy links: https://linktr.ee/natebjones\nMy substack: https://natesnewsletter.substack.com/\no3 paper: https://the-decoder.com/openais-o3-model-shows-major-gains-through-reinforcement-learning-scaling/\n\nTakeaways:\n 1. Reinforcement Learning is Key \u2013 OpenAI\u2019s O3 model excelled in a coding challenge, but its success wasn\u2019t due to domain-specific training. Instead, reinforcement learning (RL) was used to generalize problem-solving skills, making it effective across various tasks.\n 2. Verifiable Rewards Unlock Business Use Cases \u2013 RL works anywhere a task can be evaluated as correct or incorrect. This applies to business strategy, finance, sales, and marketing, where clear KPIs and structured outcomes exist.\n 3. AI Can Optimize Decision-Making \u2013 From investment portfolio management to supply chain logistics, businesses can use RL-enhanced models to make data-driven optimizations at scale, reducing reliance on handcrafted strategies.\n 4. Sales and Marketing AI Will Improve Fast \u2013 Lead scoring, ad-bidding, and customer outreach can all be optimized with AI, as RL models learn which approaches maximize engagement, conversions, and revenue.\n 5. Financial AI is Ripe for Disruption \u2013 AI-driven loan underwriting, fraud detection, and financial forecasting will improve as models optimize based on historical success and failure data.\n 6. Business AI Will Get Smarter Quickly \u2013 Over the next six months, expect major leaps in AI\u2019s ability to handle complex business workflows, thanks to reinforcement learning and model fine-tuning.\n\nQuotes:\n\u201cWe now know which business domains AI can learn quickly\u2014and they\u2019re coming sooner than you think.\u201d\n\u201cAnywhere you can say \u2018this was done correctly or incorrectly,\u2019 reinforcement learning can train AI to do the job better.\u201d\n\u201cAI isn\u2019t just coding\u2014it\u2019s optimizing entire businesses by learning from structured rewards.\u201d\n\nSummary:\nOpenAI\u2019s O3 model ranked in the top 50 of a global coding competition, but its success wasn\u2019t just about coding\u2014it was about reinforcement learning (RL). The same RL techniques that helped O3 master coding challenges can be applied across business, finance, sales, and operations. RL works whenever there\u2019s a clear success metric, whether it\u2019s investment portfolio optimization, sales funnel conversions, fraud detection, or supply chain logistics. This means AI is rapidly evolving from an assistant to a decision-maker in core business functions. Over the next six months, expect AI models to become significantly better at business optimization.\n\nKeywords:\nOpenAI, O3 model, reinforcement learning, AI optimization, business AI, competitive programming, investment portfolio AI, sales funnel AI, supply chain optimization, financial forecasting, fraud detection, loan underwriting, ad-bidding optimization, lead scoring, automation, enterprise AI, AI strategy, AI-driven decision-making, structured rewards, model fine-tuning",
