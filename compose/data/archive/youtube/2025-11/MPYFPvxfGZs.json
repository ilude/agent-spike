  "raw_transcript": "this is GPT powered coding in your terminal the real kicker here is that it allows you to both write and edit code and the cool thing about AER is that it's hands off so you type and then it does the programming this is going to be the first video in a series where I see how far I can push AI coding assistants with one ultimate goal in mind get fired I want to build an AI coding agent or use one find one that can do my work for me if that Sparks your interest and you want to get fired to or at least write code faster than ever before drop a sub like and let's get into this so I have a simple VJs application here that we're going to use AER on the kicker here is that I am not going to touch a single line of Code by hand I'm going to let AER do all the editing and all the coding so we can see how good it actually is run pip install and then export your open AI API key as you can see here I have a simple vuejs boilerplate application I'm going to open up a new terminal here and just type AER so first thing it says no get repo found create one to track gpts changes we're going to go ahead and do that go ahead and type AER it just opens up like this for us so first thing you want to do is type help just to see all the different commands so what we're going to do is get the reference to this app. viw component SL add Source app. view so you can see here that AER now has a reference to this component first thing I want to do here is see if ader understands the context of a vue.js file so if you use vue.js at all you know that there are three blocks you have your script your template and your style and we're going to see if it can just clear out this template file and do a simple hello world clear out the app. viw file and just say hello world okay so it's describing what it's going to do and then it's going to go ahead and show the original the current version and then it's going to show the updated version it's going to show its change and pay attention to this because this is really cool this is all happening live right so AER just went ahead and saved and committed that file so you know I have my server running here uh you know with hot reload running ader just saved everything right it's it's it's done all I did was type in natural language so far so good let's see if we can push this a little further increase the font size to 24 pixels okay so once again it's got the original and then it has a new style scope block so that's great so it does understand VJs and you would kind of expect that right it's using open ai's gp4 which has memory up to uh September 2021 change the background color from dark to Black CSS Transitions and then Loop infinite let's see how it does there okay so once again we're going to update the app.js file and let's see if it gets the CSS transition right all right so it looks like the dark and the black got set here and it created a brand new CSS transition for so pretty good uh you know again still we're doing simple things just trying to see where this falls apart um a lot of the coding tools right now are good in certain scenarios so we're just trying to see how far we can push this let's go ahead and uh make this a little larger so expand the hello world CSS to the entire screen 100 view width 100 view height okay so one thing that it did get wrong is that it's not looping back and forth let's see if we can go from dark to Black back to dark and then let the repeat infinite kick in update the color change to be smooth go from dark to Black back to dark okay nice so it's great looks like it got it and again like my favorite thing about this is that it just Auto saves it auto commits it does it and it looks like this is working so you know it got the 050 100% using the CSS animations um you know this is how you would do that if you're going to do it yourself so nice to see that that's working out um I want to get rid of this border here the vue.js starter template always comes with a style. CSS file with just a bunch of you know starter CSS so what I'm going to do is hit SL add I believe this is in Source style. CSS so we're going to add this new file and then we're going to look at one more um additional command that AER has which is the slash tokens so you can see here how many tokens you're using acely and you can see a lot of that just coming from the chat history so what I'm going to do here is just clear my chat history to keep my GPT cost down we are using tp4 so I'm going to hit slash clear and then slash tokens again and you can see that the total tokens are now just basically based on system messages and uh the two files that I have what I'm going to do next is update the style that CSS to remove padding and margin remove padding and margin from all B elements this is really great so you can see kind of the flow right you have files you add and remove files you run natural language commands AER runs the updates you review the updates make sure that they're right and then you you know watch your token usage and basically repeat let's go ahead and take a look here it looks like something went wrong I still have this border here uh at the side of my screen so I want to get rid of that let's look at all the margins remove all padding from style.css set them to zero okay great so it looks like that worked so now we have this nice slow fading background let me go ahead and speed up that background transition speed up the background 10 seconds so as you can see now we have our file background color changing quite a bit faster feels a little more natural good pacing people will notice this a little faster on your you know homepage website wherever ad text color is black the text is white just being super explicit there all right so it looks like it's adding another CSS animation with the color awesome and then that just saved just like that right so let's go ahead and jump back to the file we still have our template and it's you know just adding and modifying the CSS as exactly we're saying so ader's doing a really great job it's being really precise of course underneath AER it's all about gbt right it's actually gbt 4 doing this but ader is a really great developer based tool to interface and modify your code backed by gp4 right that's that's the real magic it's how do you orchestrate GPT how do you make it useful you know huge shout out to AER and the engineers building it it is so far the best AI programming assistant tool that I have used what can we do next go ahead and try to build out a tri state switch component so you've all seen a switch component it's a Boolean component where you turn it off and on but I want to build a TR State component and see if ader can pull it off so slad Source components try switch. VI it's going to ask if you want to create the file I do and now it's added it to its memory here if you do SLS you can see all the files in your chat do SL tokens just check on our token count cool now what I want to do is update the try switch act like a regular switcher where we toggle between but instead of two we toggle through three states a prop called options make the switcher transition when changing states and set the state as text on the switcher let's try that let's see what it does here so this is there's some detail here right it's a little different you don't usually build trate components it's kind of weird kind of different so let's see how it does all right so it's using the old um object based API okay so it looks like it added that let's go ahead and ask it to add the tri swich component to app. view add the component to appw view okay so on to it is updating between the three states this is really good but this is not the UI I wanted right I wanted an actual switcher component um with like like that state toggling so I'm going to say that so update Tri switch to have the UI of a regular switcher component except make it toggle between 3 x positions okay this is really good nice wow look at that that's actually incredible again I haven't actually written a single line of code but this is really cool um this is actually like something concrete right so let's see how it did this right it use style transform translate okay nice and then it's just got current state using a computer property to show off the current state and then on switch state which is on click here it just pushes the state up one it handled the absolute positioning just like that we have a tri state vuejs component this is really cool obviously it's really simple but it's it's not about where it is now it's all about where it can be in a year that's why on this channel we're digging in we're trying to build things with this right we want to we want to understand where's the tangible value if this one AI programming tool that you have some time time to take a look at check out AER it is very simple to set up literally three lines and then you just walk through one of their examples let's real quick just talk about the good and the bad so AER is a huge win for three primary reasons we don't need to switch context away from our terminal and our IDE sounds like a small thing but when you're coding for 8 hours 5 days a week this Stacks up you want to keep your contact switching to a minimal in nearly all places even switching files is a hassle if You' programmed long enough so the fact that ader is right here right in the terminal constantly open ready for you to write a command is really incredible and that leads me to the second reason why ader is really amazing it's tracking all the files in memory that's some type of memory system here you'll see when you boot this up you know it's got this dot tags thing and it's got what looks like in SQL light DB something like that that's running locally that's handling all the management of your files and lastly aer's interface is super Dev friendly and it's really simple right it does one thing and it does it pretty dang well and that is the mark of great software so what could be better I think more transparent like pricing around the tokens obviously this doesn't really have anything to do with AER but like I don't know how much this costs per command this is for sure going to stack up and become a problem instead of tokens you know tell me price even if it's just a rough estimate price per query last thing I would love to skip the pre-i it's cool but it's really slow I mean you saw you know while we were writing this out it does this huge diff thing to say the exact change and what changed before uh if you're editing a large file that's going to take quite some time I've tried GPT engineer Auto GPT and several other GPT tools I have not been inspired to create a video like I have uh with AER so hands down this is the best AI coding assistant tool so far check it out big shout out to the devs Subscribe if you want to see more content like this where I break down a tool why it's good why it's crap and just keep it super real I'm here looking for value and I'm here to share it with you keep your eyes on this type of stuff because this is a type of 2 to 10x engineering boost that can change your output forever sub like leave your thoughts in the comments and I'll see you guys in the next one",
