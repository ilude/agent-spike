  "raw_transcript": "distraction distraction distraction distraction let's fix that [Music] eliminate distractions and take control of your time manage your time your way with timebot this is time the V2 let's open Time bar and when you open time this is your landing page as you can see we have a timer progress bar but first things first let's go into the settings and see what we can do with timer so you can see here we can change the theme there are roughly 35 preset themes that you can hop in and use my favorite is the Mace Windu theme and let's go ahead and try out the timer so you can see here just by tapping on the time I kicked it off and you can see the progress bar reflects how much time you have left when you're working or studying you can visually see how much time you have left nice [Music] so the great thing about Tonda is that you can customize everything about your timer so let's go ahead and change our theme so we're going to create a custom theme we'll call this study theme and we'll just go through and update the background color we'll modify the text color here a little bit and then we'll change our secondary I think I'm thinking like a kind of a greenish yellow theme Here this can really be anything you want before bright blue there and then a dark blue for the background of the progress bar so let's see how this looks again this could be anything you want it to be the Green's kind of washed out but I like the progress bar all right cool so you know with tablet it's all about customizability so let's go ahead and update our progress bar we can copy themes if we like but let's jump in here and update our progress bar so we'll change this to the full Pi Circle and then we can modify as you can hear our alert sounds and so Tai becomes pre-built with some 12 alert sounds and of course you can add import your own alert sounds as well so we've customized our progress bar and our alert sound here and as you can hear there's our new selected sound so kind of cool again Tava is all about allowing you to manage your time your way so let's keep rolling here and look at some of the settings that we can modify so one of my favorites is Zen mode to zenmo just kind of clears up the interface and hides everything and leaves you with just your progress bar so when you're working you can throw timeba into the corner of your screen and you don't have to think about the time but it's always there so you can pay attention to it when you want to all right so let's look at some additional settings let's try out micro mode so you know I just mentioned throwing taimba into a different part of the screen let's let's change the theme here as well with micro mode here let's update our progress bar let's draw out the triangle cool so the great thing about taimba is that it has this cool feature called micro mode and it allows you to shrink the window of time the into a compact form and it will still show you how much time you have left in a progress bar fashion this works horizontally as well as vertically as you can see here our time still ticking down and this is really cool because it makes the time of a window a lot more compact so if you're doing like a huge Video Edit or you have a widescreen monitor you can shrink time but right at the bottom of the screen and use micro mode you can really get creative with this with your displays one of my favorite features of time hands down let's change to the infinity theme let's show off Pomodoro chaining so when you're working and setting up your day you're never really just focused on one thing you're focused on a series of things and Pomodoro chaining allows you to link together your activities you can see here we're going to have a 30-minute study five minute break and then we're going to jump back into you know 15 minute study session and you can chain this as much as you like you can customize this as much as you like the whole idea here is to reflect through a timer your activities chained together back to back so really powerful feature highly recommend you try that out to customize some more here so another great thing about time though is that you have hot keys so you can see here I want to modify my hotkeys to times that I normally jump into so you can keep buying one two and three and then you can press T C and A to jump between pages now here you can see that I just pressed one and the timer automatically started I'll press two and the timer automatically jumped to 15 minutes and if I press three it'll automatically jump to 10 seconds so this is a really cool way to just jump into Timba and start working right away [Music] people tend to work in intervalt blocks so you know you'll work for 30 minutes or an hour or two hours and so it's really great to set up hotkeys spacebar will start and stop your timer a lot of really cool things you can do customizing your hotkeys so with time sheets you get a load down of all of your activities over time it's a great way to keep track of how productive you are and you can see visually how you spend your time you can also drop feedback time was all about constant Improvement so if you want to report a bug or request a feature you absolutely can here's the account page time but does have a pro membership if you happen to the website here see time book gives you a Ultra lenient 30-day free trial of all the features and if you like it and you want to keep using time of uh all you need to do is pay five bucks once this is kind of unheard of in the software industry but I built Time by I'm essentially giving it away at five dollars once you guys know how subscriptions are nowadays I wanted to build something light and lean that helps you get your work done in the digital age and I wanted to create something that was cheap enough that I could give away so you know five dollars is more just a thank you if you enjoy it you know upgrade if you don't that's totally cool so it's not a it's not a subscription it's a one-time fee five bucks if you enjoy time ball you can get your member key no hard feelings otherwise it's not useful don't use it so we could just play around here lots of cool themes to play with you can really make time for your own and you know if you couldn't tell that's definitely the theme of time but it's all about how you want to manage your time so let's check out the activity autocomplete feature so you can see here once I enabled that a study tag came up and now if I you know start a timer with coding it is now an activity tag so what's happening here is that Timba is memorizing your activities so that you can quickly jump back into them so these will just Stack Up and as you start typing them they'll auto complete and when you combine this with hotkeys you can get started very quickly so cool feature time but is all about giving you what you want helping you manage your time and then it gets out of your way so when you start stacking these features together you have activity tags progress bars hotkeys Pomodoro chaining it really turns into a powerful tool that helps you manage your time management is such a personal thing so your time management tools should be customizable and personable to your style that's what Timba is that's what time is all about it's all here and it's all customizable for you you can make time by exactly the way you want it you create custom color themes you can choose from 10 progress bars you can choose from 12 alert sounds and you can also import your own sounds you'll have hot keys to jump into your work and study right away you have time sheets to review and you know those are just the big features there's tons here it's all about you it's all about your productivity it's all about your time management I built timeva to help myself and others manage their time and the digital age that we live in it's so easy to get distracted and I wanted to build something to help me and others Focus plan study write code design websites Video Edit whatever it is whatever your thing is timer can help you stay focused on one thing at a time so that you can get the most out of your time and you can do it in a super customizable way that fits your style aesthetically and functionally that's time to hope you guys enjoyed thank you so much for sticking around drop a like to help the
