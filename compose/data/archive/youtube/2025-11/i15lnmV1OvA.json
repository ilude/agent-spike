  "raw_transcript": "So here's some examples that are kind of when not to use rag. Things you can do to avoid making those kinds of mistakes. Number one, check if the base model knows it or almost knows it. I mentioned that already. Number two, this is more for a personal rag system, but if it's for stories or poems or creative writing, rag just generally doesn't work well because the semantic meaning doesn't work the same way. Number three, if you need it to be super super fast, like gaming system fast, don't bother with a rag. It's not going to work ever. uh because you just have to go and get the data and it takes time. If you have highly volatile data like stock market tickers, don't use a rag. It's not going to ever work. If you have a high maintenance cost and you don't have a really clear benefit, like if it's a small data set, don't use a rag. If you have relatively simple transformations, like basic calculations, basic formatting, there's not a lot to do, don't use a rag. It's not worth it. If it's privacy critical, you have to ensure you can't store user data. And if you do, you're in trouble.",

RAG Fixes LLM Blind Spots: By pairing vector search with large-language models, Retrieval-Augmented Generation eliminates knowledge cut-offs, slashes hallucinations, and securely injects company data into answers.\n 2. Explosive Enterprise Adoption: The RAG market is climbing from today\u2019s ~$2 B to a forecast $40 B by 2035, with roughly 80 % of enterprises choosing RAG over fine-tuning for real-time data access.\n 3. Data & Chunking Decide Success: Clean text, smart metadata, and overlapping semantic chunks (not model size) make or break retrieval accuracy\u2014bad chunking is the #1 RAG killer.\n 4. Roadmap from Prototype to Planet-Scale: Simple FAQ bots stand up in a week, but scaling to multimodal, agentic, enterprise-grade RAG demands hybrid search, sharded vector DBs, caching, cost controls, and rigorous security/compliance.\n 5. Know When Not to RAG: Skip it for high-volatility data, creative writing, ultra-low-latency workflows, or tiny datasets where the next model upgrade suffices\u2014several firms learned this the expensive way.\n 6. The Future Is Agentic & Connected: Million-token context windows, Model Context Protocol, and agentic planning will merge with RAG, not replace it, keeping retrieval as the precision memory layer of AI systems.\n\nQuotes:\n\u201cWe\u2019re giving LLMs an open-book exam instead of a closed book, and the score difference is enormous.\u201d\n\u201cBad chunking ruins more RAG projects than bad models\u2014data discipline beats model size every time.\u201d\n\u201cRAG isn\u2019t a magic bullet; use it where your proprietary data matters and skip it where the next model update will suffice.\u201d\n\nSummary:\nIn this video I break down Retrieval-Augmented Generation as the pragmatic fix for large-language-model blind spots. I explain how RAG pairs embeddings, smart chunking and vector search to ground answers in real data, share enterprise wins like LinkedIn\u2019s faster support and RBC\u2019s compliant agent assist, and map a five-level roadmap from simple FAQ bots to multimodal, agentic, enterprise-grade systems. I warn where RAG backfires\u2014volatile data, creative writing, trivial tasks\u2014and stress disciplined data pipelines, evaluation and security from day one. Looking ahead, bigger context windows and MCP will fuse with RAG, not replace it, keeping retrieval central to real-world AI.\n\nKeywords:\nRAG, Retrieval Augmented Generation, embeddings, vector database, chunking, cosine similarity, hybrid search, multimodal RAG, agentic RAG, MCP, context windows, hallucination mitigation, enterprise AI, fine-tuning, data pipelines",
