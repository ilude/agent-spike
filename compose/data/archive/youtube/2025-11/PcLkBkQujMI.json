  "raw_transcript": "what's up Engineers Andy Deb Dan here today I have something incredible to share with you I want to introduce you to marimo a Next Generation python notebook I've got a three course special for you today these three pieces of value will help you win in the age of generative AI first we're going to break down the marimo reactive notebooks and talk about why it's so important to have a rapid prototyping tool like this well then see how we can use marimo to quickly run individual prompts and run a single prompt against every state-of-the-art large language model by clicking a single check box lastly I want to share the early stages of what my prompt Library looks like to give you ideas on how you can build maintain and grow your own agentic Library so first things first we have to talk about marimo this is a brand new tool that aims to replace Jupiter notebooks python notebooks and notebooks in general are places where Engineers can rapidly build out ideas and features it's often used in Ai and ml engineering to pull in data to experiment on data to get insights build artifacts test out ideas so on and so forth marimo has a couple of really really interesting killer features first they're importing they're then creating a markdown item and you can see here the markdown H1 gets rendered directly directly above the block they created a variable in items let me go and zoom in on this a little bit they created a variable in items as soon as they changed it the cells that reference that variable you can see here there are n items it automatically gets updated now they've changed it to a slider and the slider automatically updates that value and every other cell that has a reference now they're pulling in a chart and this chart then of course is getting fully rendered and is reactively updating based on this slider they're then going to hop into some data exploration and honestly things are moving so quickly here it's better if we just jump into this ourselves and really see how these notebooks can help you build and rapidly prototype software in the age of AI here we have a code base that we're going to slowly build up on so we have three notebooks here we're going to start with this after you run the installation instructions you'll be able to kick off this command here we're just going to go ahead and fire this off so right away a notebook gets opened up for us and the first thing I'm going to do here is get out of Dev mode and go into what I like to call user mode I'm going to hit command Dot and now we're presented with this simple UI now a key part about marimo that differentiates it between other notebooks is that it is reactive so if I look at the slider here and I slide this you can see we have a value just below getting updated let me go and bump the size a little bit so if I scroll here you can see that value is getting updated right if I click this check boox again we have state getting updated right so we have UI automatically updating state right let's type in this input field hello Maro is awesome and if I blur or hit enter we're going to get the text field value I want you to hold onto that key idea while we move through this so what else can we do with marimo we have reactive data visualization right so we have this plot here it's a simple data frame with some random data right now it's a scatter plot if we want to we can change its form we want to see a line chart perfect if we want to see the bar version we can go ahead and do that as well nice and clean nice and simple so you can already kind of see this being useful for data exploration right if we scroll down we do have conditional output and control flow if I hit this checkbox of course based on a bing we can render different content right if we check that off it'll change turn it on it'll change again if we drag and drop a CSV file we can automatically get a breakdown of the data and so this basically just converted a hand's data frame and gave us a really really clean layout of a bunch of fields right you can see here all the columns we can do some sorting let's descend on location let's Ascend on age right so you can see this mock user data set getting broken down right and then we have some Advanced UI components right we have classic uh accordion we have nested slider in here and then we have a data frame display okay we have things like tabs we have forms images videos layouts and fullon interactive data Exploration with just a few lines of code so this is incredible what we're going to do now is hop out of user mode so I like to call this user mode and then if we hit command dot we'll hop into Builder mode or engineering mode right so basically these notebooks are now showing the code surrounding them so we have all of our Imports here you can see we have all the markdown getting displayed in these sections and then we can see what exactly these components look like right so super clean Super declarative if you've used Swift UI or any framework where you define your elements in line you'll be very familiar and you'll be very accustomed to how marimo creates components right so we have slider checkbox input field and then we're just rendering them in a vstack right and if we want to we can just switch this right now hstack command enter and all of a sudden we're floating left to right and we just you know really quickly updated the UI of our elements so I'll revert that back and we can do the same thing in developer mode right I'm checking this I'm changing this I'm typing you know test input input value hitting enter and you can see that all gets updated there if you want to we can hop in here and do something kind of fun we can paste this and say slider. Val and multiply it by the text input value and of course this is going to render that value multiple times right so let's go ahead and do something else let's change text input to like just an emoji or something right so if we do something like this place a star here rerender we can now change this value and reactively one of the highlights of Maro is that this is fully reactive right so as the slider goes up our stars go up and down so let's talk about how we can use this wonderful reusable very visual interactive notebook to get an edge in the age of AI let's look at a concrete use case of using this tool for prompt engineering for prompt management and ultimately to build your own prompt Library [Music] all right so if we hop back to the readme and copy this paste this and run it you can see here that we have a ad hoc prompt notebook and again command dot we're now in user mode right so before we were in kind of deep engineering mode you can see all the code you can see all the details you can quickly tweak and modify you hit command Dot and now you're just focus in on consuming the tool right consuming the use case and you can imagine this is super useful for yourself looking back at products for you and I on the channel sharing ideas sharing tools but also for other Engineers on your team and for your product managers and your product team so you can see here we have a couple input fields we have prompt we have temperature we have a model and if we click the model drop down you can see we have all the state-of-the-art models at our disposal and then we can hit run on all models so let's just do a test prompt we'll just say ping we'll run on son 3.5 and we'll hit submit so you can see two new blocks have appeared we have the form values which are just the values of our form from above and we also have the prompt output so let's go ahead and run something else we'll say count to 10 Z then Implement python then in typescript okay and then we'll just hit submit so just running another random prompt here on Sonic 3.5 you can see they got kicked off and we got a nice response there we have markdown we have code and this is just a simple reusable ad hoc prompt tool again if we just hit command dot we can switch into to engineering mode and we can see exactly how this works so we have Imports we're pulling in our models we're creating a map between the name and the value of our model we have our inputs so you can see here you know we're literally just creating m.i. text area m.i. slider drop down and then we have a checkbox and so remember I said in the beginning you know one checkbox is going to run this prompt against every single one of our models so you know what while we're looking at this we can go ahead and just kick this off so I'll say run on models and let's make it do something more interesting right let's say uh create a pros and cons of typescript versus python explain when to use both and then we'll hit submit here so that's just going to be kicking off in the background and you can see here we're taking Maro components and we're throwing them in a form you know that's how we got our text rendered that's how we got our temp our model and our run all right so really kind of simple declarative UI uh it's easy to reason about it's easy to consume and think about you can see here we just have ad hoc prompt and then we just in text we place our four components we then run this batch to kind of insert our data into the MD and then we call form on this so theform is what creates the submit button we can then click that and get our submitted output right we can see our form values just as before and this is a simple you know looping through our form and just grabbing the values based on the key and then we use the mo ui. component and then we just throw that inside of a markdown block right so that's how we get that if we scroll down here you can see this is our loader for our single prompt execution takes the form value form prompt and the form temperature if we're running the 01 or Gemini prompts the temperature just gets set to one inside of this llm module prompt with temperature function so if we scroll down some more you can see we have our multimodel prompt completed we have a H1 you can see we have a nice clean table right model ID and then the output we have the Sonet 3.5 answer to our pros and cons table comparing typescript and python we also have our 01 mini 01 preview you know you can already kind of tell that the reasoning model outputs are much richer and then we have gpg 40 latest o mini Gemini 1.5 and Flash and if we scroll down to see what that looks like it's really really simple right we're taking our our list of objects placing that in the table and then we're just throwing that in a vstack since I'm not running any computations in the cell it just reruns no problem all the data in the previous cells that it's used inside of this cell uh doesn't need to change or update right so this is really really powerful I hope you can see the value in this we're in engineering mode we can come in here we can add models we can update our list we can add new UI items very very quickly if we haven't clicked submit you know our our form won't have any values to display so this block just won't show up same thing with the values down here and in just two cells we're able to build a multi-model execution prompt that runs the same prompt against several models in just eight cells or so we've replaced a ton of tools right you you you've probably seen or use a tool that does basically just this right it's a simple chat GPT replacement with a couple extra nice features and and tweaks right so this is just a minimal example of how you can build a simple reusable prompt notebook that you can hop into run prompts test your prompts against different models and just kind of get an idea for prompts and easily see and read the output right if you want to we can uncheck we can fire off a mini and then we can just get that response right so if we hit submit all of our reactive cells that are dependent on the form are now recomputing and giving us a concise result right so you can see there the 01 mini is giving us a really really great breakdown of when to use typescript versus python so before we move onto the prompt Library I want to call out another incredible Maro feature inside of the display user mode we can come over to this drop down and display as a grid and as slides great engineering really comes down to two things build great software and then communicate the great software that you've built this tool allows you to do both of those things so let's switch over to grid mode here and as you can imagine we can now drag and drop the cells that we've been building up right so we now have this cell here let's just say I wanted this View and I wanted I want my prompt output view right I just want to keep it really simple here when I'm in this mode widen this a little bit okay so let's just go ahead and run another prompt right so let's just drop down to 40 and let's just rerun you can see we got the loading State and now we're just looking at these two cells left to right super concise super simple it's rendering our prompts and we can pull in any cell that we want for instance if we wanted to we can pull in our form values component and move that over here make this a little wider so we can see everything that's actually getting computed from this and again it's all reactive so if I you know maximize this if I switch to 1.5 Pro resubmit both of these items because they Depend and have state referenced in this original cell all of those States will get updated right so now we have our new model temperature so on and so forth Maro notebooks are incredible right we have rapid prototyping we have reactive notebooks we have data visualization which we haven't tapped into too much yet and we have easy interactivity let's go ahead and keep pushing you know this is just another fantastic way to view the work you've done there's also a mode where you can run it in slides for o latus let's make it super specific and then we can hit submit and then in our you know future items here you know while this is loading it's going to run in this slide mode really interesting way to kind of view manage and update your code so let's go ahead and switch back to Vertical view so that you have a good idea of how this works go ahead and hit the like hit the sub and let's hop into how we can use Maro Next Generation python notebooks to build a reusable prompt Library so let's dive into our third notebook I'm going to copy this UV run command and this is going to kick off our prompt Library notebook right away I'm going to collapse all the code and we're just going to talk about this from a high level we don't need to see all the nitty-gritty details we're reviewing the product we're reviewing the tool and we're just talking high level so you can see here we have a similar UI have a nice H1 header we have a form with a submit button and here we can select an llm so let's go ahead and just select um let's go and use o1 Mini and now we're going to select a prompt so you can see here I have four prompts three of these you'll recognize from the previous 01 reasoning model video we're going to use the bullet knowledge compression prompt and hit submit so we've now locked in our prompt if I hit click to show you can see we can view this prompt right here and if we want to we can go ahead and change our prompt hit submit again and you can see we've now selected that other prompt right so this is a YouTube video Chapter prompt that automatically generates YouTube chapters based on timestamps and SEO keywords let's go ahead and hop back let's keep this simple for this example here's the amazing part that makes this prompt library and that makes Maro notebooks really powerful we have this block that we want to update you want to reuse your prompts right you don't want to spend a bunch of time and then throw your prompt away there's massive value in reusing your prompts and most importantly adding variables to your prompts so you can see here we have a variable content and this Maro notebook takes that content and finds this pattern it takes the variable within it and creates a text area so now we can fill in this text area here and what I'll do here is I'll pull I'll pull the legendary how to succeed in Mr be production PDF this PDF went viral a couple weeks ago I think there are some seriously valuable nuggets of information in here so let's go ahead and just grab a piece of content one of my favorite sections was where is a critical components yeah this is so relatable in engineering so I'm going to copy this and what I'm going to do is just paste this inside of our prompt variable and I'll hit prompt so we have another cell that just got kicked off now that we have a value and something really cool is going to happen here 01 mini is churning and now it has a result for us it followed the prompt perfectly by creating a list of ideas with a theme and then some bullet points underneath we can click to show the context filled prompts which has our variable filled in and replaced with this Dynamic text area I hope you can see where this is going right and I hope you can see how valuable this is in the age of generative AI let me just go ahead let's do a refresh here let's restart reset the kernel and let's go back into user mode and let's just run that over again we're going to select the prompt we want to select a model hit submit we want to pass in the context and prompt okay so in literally no time right and four clicks I have reused a it's a fairly simple prompt but this could be much much more complex right in our previous video we looked at an AI coding meta review prompt if we look at that prompt you can see we have two variables here right so this is an AI coding prompt check out the previous video to see more details on this but we'll pass in our code files and the diff of our code and then we're going to get a full comprehensive code review right so this prompt can be easily and quickly reused using Mar notebooks there are a ton of ways to push this further but I want to share with you how I'm starting to build out and organize my prompts inside of a reusable prototyp notebook marot is also really incredible because it's a great tool we can use on the channel to kind of share and show ideas in a more visual datar Rich way but if we hop into the code here if we hop into engineering mode you can see we have Imports you can see I have this method that is pulling in my map prompt library and you know we can just dial into this if we want if I just hit enter here and run this you can see it's a simple map between the file and the prompt that's inside of the file if we open up our editor we can just crack that open and you can see underneath prompt Library I just have four prompts here we can click into that and you can see the you know AI coding meta review you can see the bullet knowledge compressor and the other prompts are here as well right so we just have a simple python function that's pulling that in and creating this dictionary for us right it's just fully reactive super easy to just dive in see what the code is doing see what it looks like I'm building all of our models here creating a map we have some simple CSS styles that I use for the prompts and then we have our user interface for our primary controls you can see here MMD we're using batch to pass in these values and then we're using form to turn it into a form so that we can utilize these items after they're submitted specifically throughout the rest of our cells let's go ahead and run our haacker newes sentiment analysis uh we'll use 01 mini this is a heavier prompt so now we have a vertical stack with just a simple H1 header right that's just our selected prompt header and then we have this accordion right so this is really cool click to show and then it maps to another component so we'll click to show and then you can see there it's just showing the prompt that we selected right so this is our Hacker News sentiment analysis prompt we can go ahead and close that and then here we have the text area right so we're doing some dynamic work here to find every item inside the prompt between these delimeters right so we have this you know left curly right curly and then we use that to dynamically create text area components you can imagine us pushing this further maybe you want some PDF components maybe you want a file selector where you pull in all the files just a kind of hint hint at where this prompt framework is going and then you can of course run the prompt so when the prompt runs it comes down here we have a couple variable Stoppers so you know if we don't have any array items or if the button hasn't been pressed just do nothing right that's what this stop does this is really important in this reactive environment down here we actually have the run so let's go ahead and just kick this off let's quick hop on Hacker News let's find a post this one looks interesting so I'm just going to go ahead hop into this copy the ID go to hn. algolia paste in the ID copy these items just like before four instead of going to the CLI and creating a file we're just going to paste it all right here and something that would be really great to add to this would be to create a simple token counter or at least a word counter for now I'm just going to open up a cursor hit paste and you can see here I have about 8,000 tokens that's fine I'll go ahead and hit prompt down at the bottom here you can see our prompt is now spinning this is what's running right now right so we're running the 01 model you can see we got the model dropped down from our form and then we're passing that in along with our context fill prompt and into our python method this is just a classic llm prompt function and there's our results right so this is our hacker new sentiment analysis if we hop into user mode we can see this in a clean format we got both the markdown and the Json version with negative sentiment analysis of this Hacker News Post a Nuance View and then a positive view so this is awesome you know don't worry about what's in the content too much again check out the previous video to see what exactly we did there with The Hacker News sentiment analysis prompt this is a much much faster way to to use and consume your prompts in the age of large language models and in the age of generative AI the most important thing we can do as Engineers is increase our ability to rapidly prototype and iterate products and tools and also increase our ability to rapidly prototype with large language models prompt engineering although originally a complete meme joke is probably one of the most serious professions there are now and as Engineers we have a massive Advantage because we can utilize tools like Maro to build out these incredible reusable notebooks that allow us to manipulate information faster than anyone don't let anyone confuse you you and I and every engineer we are the kings of knowledge work the ability to use tools like this to manipulate data to build out prompts to build out prompt Frameworks and prompt libraries like this means that you can control and manipulate information faster than anyone I wanted to share this with you the link for this code base is going to be in the description I highly recommend you check this out there's a ton of value here in getting started with Maro notebooks for agentic engineering but also just for you know standard software engineering where you're Building Products you're testing out ideas and again you're sharing ideas there are two m of pieces to software engineering there's building products and then there's sharing the value that the product has notebooks like Maro and Jupiter notebooks help communicate the value that has been created the massive Advantage I see here with Maro is that it allows you to think about things in an interactive user focused way again I know I've been a broken record about this but the command dot switching from product Focus from high level from user focused to the engineering level is just a to die for feature that I absolutely love to see in a tool like this so again you know command dot we're switching between engineering and product mode in no time one of the really important things about these notebooks is that it's air quotes just python so you know if we hop over to our prompt Library notebook and collapse everything you can see here that it's just a bunch of appell decor ators with some really fancy graph State Management happening and you can see here right we have that cell where we're building out our models at the top and if we go into developer mode in the UI you know that's exactly what's happening here right so line one is our LM Sonet and if we search that you can see that that is that cell exactly right so you know exactly what this means it means that you can easily commit and modify these files right so we can you know commit these files push them easily manage them and understand them this is a massive advantage over jupyter notebooks because jupyter notebooks they store all of the output but it also enables us to very importantly use AI to write this for us in fact most of what you're seeing here I generated using AER and using cursor you can imagine you open up AER you add the file to the context and then you just start prompting right so you can say ask how can I add another sell so you can get a nice breakdown there we don't need to go into this we have other videos on that and more coming in the future great engineering is all about rapidly building valuable software and communicating that value to others marmo is a fantastic tool that helps you do that and I had to bring this to you and I had to share this with you I have not been excited about a non-generative AI tool since duck database came out and this is a tool that is going to change the game for you if you give it a good shot and if you understand how valuable it can be to have a reactive notebook that can help you rapidly prototype your tools and products in the age of generative AI you need every Edge you can get and this is a massive one the idea to take this and create your own prompt Library I think is very novel very interesting very cool because you can come in here switch to Dev mode and just start hacking away on exactly how you want to organize your prompt framework this is just the beginning of this I'm going to be sharing more on my personal prompt library and how I'm organizing my prompts to help give you ideas on how you can do the same thanks so much for watching if you enjoyed the video drop a like drop a comment and I'll see you in the next one",
