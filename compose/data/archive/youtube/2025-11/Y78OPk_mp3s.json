It actually helps you to focus them in ways that are useful. Number two, text is currency.",

Extreme Specificity Focuses Models: The tighter your word counts, formats, and numbered requirements, the sharper ChatGPT-5 (and today\u2019s models) will perform.\n 2. Context Is Currency: With context windows racing toward the million-token mark, front-load full documents, history, and constraints\u2014just keep every byte relevant.\n 3. Multi-Phase Workflows Go Native: Stop treating step-by-step prompts as hacks; GPT-5 will natively traverse multi-stage thinking and creation inside a single run.\n 4. Structured Output by Default: Demand scorecards, matrices, phased plans, or XML tags\u2014clear schemas unlock more reliable reasoning and easier downstream use.\n 5. Interrogative & Self-Check Loops: Great prompts encourage the model to ask clarifying questions and critique its own answers before you ever hit \u201csend.\u201d\n 6. Project-Manager Chunking: Break massive research into smaller deliverables, synthesize later, and iterate\u2014Agile-style prompting scales with expanding context windows.\n\nQuotes\n\u201cWe\u2019re moving from asking if AI can help to architecting a true partnership.\u201d\n\u201cSpecificity isn\u2019t a cage; it\u2019s the fine brush that paints your vision on an LLM canvas.\u201d\n\u201cContext windows are exploding\u2014treat every token like jet fuel for focused reasoning.\u201d\n\nSummary\nI argue that you can prepare for ChatGPT-5 today by refining how you prompt current frontier models. The next wave will reward extreme specificity, rich but relevant context, and multi-phase workflows executed in one shot. Structured outputs, interrogative prompts, and built-in self-evaluation loops will become table stakes. As context windows balloon toward millions of tokens, effective prompting shifts from magic phrases to precise architecture: clear goals, constraints, and chunked tasks. Prompts are thinking tools that shape both the model\u2019s reasoning and my own, forging a bidirectional partnership that scales human creativity rather than replacing it.\n\nKeywords\nChatGPT-5, prompting, extreme specificity, context windows, multi-phase workflows, structured output, self-evaluation loops, interrogative prompts, AI partnership, Wayne Gretzky, project-manager chunking, million-token context, AI architecture, prompt design, frontier models",
