  "raw_transcript": "I wanted to give you a strategic perspective on AWS reinvent so it's going on right now why is Amazon launching what it's launching it's not just because it's AI it's not just because it's on Trend I've worked at Amazon I know how strategic they are from the inside fundamentally what Amazon is doing is it's playing a 15-year catchup game right now it was surprised by the launch of Chad GPT along with the rest of the world we were all surprised in 2022 and it takes some time for a company that big to Pivot and what we are seeing now in Las Vegas is the results of the whole company pivoting under Andy Jesse and at the end of the day if you're looking for what the big plays are like in between the lines like there's about a million different things they've launched AWS what are the ones that matter I would argue that there are three big strategic moves that matter the first one is at the chip level when they acquired anap porna labs they acquired a chip designer and what Amazon needed was a chip that would enable them to cut costs on their own model development and break their costly dependency on Nvidia because for Amazon Nvidia is a massive cost center and Amazon is a notoriously Frugal company and they don't appreciate being locked into a a costly chipet that they have no control over so they're building their own they acquired anap pora labs they launched the trinium 2 chip yesterday in Las Vegas to General availability they claim it's super effective at training for large language models maybe it is I don't know it's probably well-designed I think there's a difference between a chip that has been launched and a chip that has been proven at data center scale and that is what Nvidia is going to call out because like it or not Nvidia is the only one that really has the ability to say our chips are proven at data center scale and they're proven at data center scale all over the world and we help with designing server racks and we work with multiple companies and we are the people on gpus for training large language models nobody else can say that Amazon is hoping to say it this is a long game but Amazon is hoping to get into that position in the industry over time and they're Relentless like they're going to come out with trinium 3 trinium 4 like it's coming so you move up from the chipset in the in the stack the next big play they're making is an ecosystem play right now open AI wants to claim that they work with Azure and they work with Microsoft and like that is the stack to go to for Enterprise and what Amazon wants to say is the AWS Bedrock service is the stack to go to the AWS Bedrock service is where you want to be for AI and it's not just for the models it's for all everything that goes with them so when they launched automated reasoning for example that's an example of a smaller service that they see fitting into a larger ecosystem of value around Bedrock that would make it attractive for an Enterprise now we get to the model Nova is their new Cutting Edge model that they just announced Nova is clearly going to be a class that already has a pro and a light and a something else like so many different versions when you look at the test results Nova comes in in what we call the four class model so Chad gp24 level capabilities so it's about where everybody else is it's not cutting edge any more than anybody else is it's a little bit worse than Claude by a lot of benchmarks but not a lot like just a touch um and so what you get is a model that's good for most use cases they'll probably wrap it in with preferential pricing again it's an Enterprise play to wrap you into the AWS ecosystem it's not necessarily a reason to switch if you're an Azure customer that brings us to Claude they just invested $4 billion in Claude which is chump change for them but it's a hedge play at the end of the day they want to be working with a model that is testing really really really well that's testing even better than their own Nova model and they want to be able to they use Claude for Cutting Edge use cases that show that they're on the Forefront of the AI wave they are buying their way to the Forefront of the AI wave and so Claude is being used in for example the supercomputer that they announced at Nova or the supercomputer that they announced uh in Las Vegas at reinvent and at the end of the day the supercomputer to me feels like a deeply symbolic project of course you need to show you can do something with a supercomputer of course you need to use the Cutting Edge model clad to do it mostly the value there is going to be in being able to tell companies you're selling to that you're building a supercomputer with Claude because it makes them more likely to purchase from AWS that's the play so we'll see I worked at a division at Amazon that was playing from the number two position for a while uh that was a Prime video and I know how Relentless Amazon is and how patient they are firsthand this is looking to me like they are setting themselves up to overtime out execute Microsoft and open AI in the Enterprise space so we will see but that's how I read reinvent that's the context I have for it so when you look at the news when you look at all the announcements don't get lost like that's the Strategic play that Amazon is making",

    "title": "Here's How AWS re:Invent is Showing Amazon's AI Strategy",
    "description": "About me: https://natebjones.com/\nMy links: https://linktr.ee/natebjones\n\nAbout re:invent: https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/top-announcements-of-aws-reinvent-2024/\n\nTakeaways:\n 1. Amazon\u2019s Chip Strategy: Amazon is moving to cut its dependency on Nvidia with the launch of Trainium 2, a custom chip aimed at reducing costs and optimizing AI workloads for large-scale data centers.\n 2. AWS Bedrock Ecosystem: AWS Bedrock positions itself as the go-to enterprise AI stack by integrating tools and models like Nova, automated reasoning, and infrastructure to create a cohesive ecosystem for enterprise users.\n 3. Nova Foundation Models: Amazon\u2019s Nova models deliver GPT-4-level capabilities with multimodal support, tailored for enterprise use. While not cutting-edge, their value lies in integration with AWS\u2019s broader offerings.\n 4. Anthropic Partnership: Amazon\u2019s $4 billion investment in Anthropic adds cutting-edge Claude models to its ecosystem, serving as a hedge to ensure AWS remains competitive in the AI race.\n 5. Long-Term Execution: Amazon is playing the long game, leveraging its frugality, cloud dominance, and iterative chip development to challenge competitors like Microsoft, OpenAI, and Google in enterprise AI.\n 6. Enterprise AI Focus: Amazon\u2019s strategy targets enterprise clients, emphasizing reliability, scalability, and cost-efficiency over consumer-facing AI trends.\n\nQuotes:\n \u2022 \u201cTrainium is Amazon\u2019s play to break free from Nvidia\u2019s costly dominance and build chips optimized for their ecosystem.\u201d\n \u2022 \u201cAWS Bedrock is Amazon\u2019s ecosystem play, positioning itself as the enterprise AI stack for integrated tools and scalability.\u201d\n \u2022 \u201cAmazon isn\u2019t just catching up\u2014it\u2019s building a vertically integrated AI ecosystem designed to define enterprise AI for the next decade.\u201d\n\nSummary:\nAmazon\u2019s announcements at AWS re:Invent reflect a deliberate pivot toward AI, targeting enterprise dominance. The launch of Trainium 2 challenges Nvidia with cost-efficient AI hardware, while AWS Bedrock integrates Nova foundation models and enterprise tools into a cohesive ecosystem. Amazon\u2019s $4 billion investment in Anthropic adds Claude\u2019s cutting-edge AI capabilities as a hedge against competitors. While Nova isn\u2019t leading the market, Amazon\u2019s strategic focus on reliability, scalability, and cost-efficiency positions it to compete long-term with Microsoft, OpenAI, and Google in the enterprise AI space. These moves signal Amazon\u2019s commitment to reshaping the AI landscape.\n\nKeywords:\nAmazon, AWS, Trainium, Trainium 2, Nvidia, Anthropic, Claude, Nova models, AWS Bedrock, enterprise AI, OpenAI, Microsoft, Azure, Google, Gemini, AI ecosystem, AI chips, cloud computing, automated reasoning, AI strategy, enterprise solutions, artificial intelligence, frugality, innovation.",
