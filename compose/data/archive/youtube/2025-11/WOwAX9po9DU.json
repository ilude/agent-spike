  "raw_transcript": "And I find that this is where a lot of consultants, whether they're established or whether they're new, go astray. They tend to say, \"We're going to zero in on AI. All we do is AI.\" But AI is it's hard to put your fingers on. I've talked about that already in this video. It's a general purpose technology. You can do it with development. You can do it with process change. You can do it with a dozen other things in the consulting world, marketing, etc. You need to pick a particular domain that you can own. You need to pick a particular domain where if you have an opinion on how AI agents should be deployed in that domain, you you should be believed. You have authority there. You have a decade of experience. That is part of why when I speak about product and AI, I tend to have very strong opinions because I did product management for a long long time. When I speak about founding an AI, I tend to have opinions because I have found it before, etc.",

    "description": "My site: https://natebjones.com\nMy substack: https://natesnewsletter.substack.com/\nStory: https://natesnewsletter.substack.com/p/the-end-to-end-ai-client-value-playbook?r=1z4sm5\n\nTakeaways\n 1. Distribution Is King: Consultants who already own client relationships can scale fastest\u2014provided their AI advice is substantive, not surface-level.\n 2. Kill the AI-Wash: Buzzword-heavy pitches (\u201cAI-powered everything\u201d) destroy credibility; clients expect clear, technically sound answers like when RAG is appropriate.\n 3. Own a Specific Domain: Wrap AI around deep sector expertise\u2014much like a strangler fig\u2014so your niche authority and pricing power grow together.\n 4. Package With Living Templates: AI lets templates evolve in real time, making services sharply scoped yet highly customizable for each engagement.\n 5. Build a Trusted Network: No one covers the full value chain; cultivate specialist partners so you can bring the right \u201cJames\u201d to every project.\n 6. Publish to Prove Credibility: Sharing detailed, NDA-safe insights publicly separates you from the sea of generic \u201cAI consultants\u201d and fuels referrals.\n\nQuotes\n\u201cWe don\u2019t need more AI slogans; we need consultants who can answer, \u2018When should I use RAG\u2014and why?\u2019\u201d\n\u201cA strangler-fig strategy works: grow AI expertise around the trunk of the domain you already dominate.\u201d\n\u201cIf you AI-wash today, you don\u2019t just lose the deal\u2014you poison the whole ecosystem tomorrow.\u201d\n\nSummary\nI argue that great AI consultants win by combining genuine domain mastery with deep, specific AI fluency rather than vague \u201cAI-washing.\u201d Distribution still rules, so leverage an existing book of business or build one through clear, public content that showcases expertise. Focus on a narrow niche, articulate concrete deliverables, and back them with living, AI-enabled templates. Cultivate trusted partners for adjacent parts of the value chain and stay transparent to avoid poisoning the ecosystem with overhyped claims. When consultants pair granular knowledge with credible, outcome-oriented packages, they command higher fees and earn the long-term trust that keeps clients coming back.\n\nKeywords\nAI consulting, distribution, AI-washing, domain expertise, specificity, RAG, templates, partnerships, content marketing, trust, value chain, niche, client retention",
