  "raw_transcript": "Your impact as an engineer is directly limited or enhanced by the tools you use. Some tools compound your impact while others hold you back. Claw Code is clearly a tool that compounds your impact that's built for real engineers doing real engineering work. A sign of a great tool is how much the open-source ecosystem rallies around the tool. In this video, I want to share three oddly useful repositories you can use to get more out of claw code and push your agentic coding further. If you don't know what your tool can do, you don't know what you can do. [Music] In the terminal, we can type a single line and understand how much value we're really getting out of cloud code. We can run npx CC usage latest since beginning of this month on the 1st. When we fire this off, this of course is a breakdown of my clog code usage. As you can see, I've spent well over my $200 clog code max plan. I am saving a ton of money with this plan. If we scroll up, you can see my dayby-day breakdown of each model. You can see all the input, all the output, and all the cached token usage along with their price with a dayby-day breakdown for true off-device agent coding. I have API keys running. It would be awesome if we could roll in even more usage into our max plan, but you know, you can see here I'm getting plenty of value out of the max plan. I don't blame Entropic for not supporting that. API keys are simple. I highly recommend you run this simple command. If I hit up here, you can see exactly what we just ran there right through npx cloud code usage latest and then you can pass in a sense state. They have a bunch of command line flags you can use. And when you look at your cost breakdown, you have to remember it's an ROI question. It's a return on investment question just like the creator of claw code mentioned. The way I think about it is it's a ROI question. It's not a cost question. And so if you think about, you know, an average engineer salary, like engineers are very expensive. And if you can make an engineer 50 70% more productive, that's worth a lot. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So this is this is huge. I'm so glad they mentioned this. Um this is where a lot of engineers make a critical mistake. Your time is your most valuable resource. Let me say it one more time. Your time is your most valuable resource. I've saved 30 to 50 hours, probably more of engineering work just this month so far because I'm offloading more and more agentic coding to tools like cloud code. Run this command to get a breakdown of your cloud code usage so you can understand the true value you're getting out of this tool. Vibe coders use tools blindly, firing off prompts after prompts after prompts. Good engineers use their tools well and have a highle idea of how things work. Great Genai engineers know exactly what their tools are doing on a fundamental level. This next oddly useful tool can help you really master cloud code on a fundamental level. Let's move into the quick data MCP server we built in a previous video to explore reusable MCP server prompts. Now, if I run this command here, this is going to fire up a clawed trace. Let's fire this off. And right away, it looks like a normal claw code bootup, except we have this log file, this trace file getting stored toclude trace. Let's run a couple commands and understand what this tool does for us. Hello. Classic hello response. What does this project do? And then while this is running, I'll queue up use a sub agent to document the primary flow of MCP server prompts in this app. All right, so I'll get that queued up as well. So you can see that first task was completed there. Five tool uses, 32K context. You can see exactly what this tool is all about. It's for simple data manipulation. We're also using resources and prompt templates. And now we're running another prompt here to understand the flow. So this is not new. We've been looking at cloud code subtask and sub aents on the channel for weeks now. After our sub agent finishes, right now it's gathering context in its isolated subtask context window. When it finishes, it's going to return a result to our top level cloud code agent. Then we'll close cloud code and something really interesting is going to happen here. So there it is. Took a minute. That's a lot of engineering work that I didn't do. Our agent did it for us. And there we go. So we have the entry point, core flow analysis, specialized analysis, so on and so forth. So, but now comes the interesting part. I'm going to close this version of cloud code here. And right away, we get this HTML file. You can see here it's inside of this cloud trace directory. And this is actually just a full-on local HTML file that we can use to inspect all Claude code traffic. You can see here if we start scrolling, we have a complete breakdown of our conversation with cloud code. But very interestingly here we can see cloud code firing off sub aents. And look at this cloud code is let me zoom in a little bit. You can see here cloud code is acting as a user when is kicking off the subtasks. So it's literally like we're prompting cloud code but this is cloud code talking to its sub agent. Okay. So this is a really really interesting pattern. We've been talking about cloud code sub aents and parallel agents but this is what's actually happening under the hood. There are two really important, very informative details that Claude Trace offers you that can help you uplevel what you can do with Claude code. We have full access to the system prompt. So, you can just read through this and really understand how much information and how much detail anthropic engineers are packing in to the system prompt. And then we have the tools. So, I think the tools are the most fascinating part here because we're getting a long description breakdown of what exactly every Cloud Code tool does and how it's written. So, you can see the parameters here with a shorter description, but then you can see the actual description here, right? This is the full-on tool description for launching sub aents. All right, so this is what Claw Code is using when it's firing off sub agents to do engineering work on your behalf, right? Launch a new agent with access to the following tools. And you can see there it has a couple tools we're going to get to in just a second via a custom MCP server. And then it's got a couple different sections and some great usage notes, right? Launch multiple sub aents concurrently whenever possible to maximize performance. Very important key note here. And you can look at this for every single tool in cloud code. By understanding the exact tool definitions, we can leverage cloud code in new powerful ways. And we can really understand how all these tools work at a deep level. So outside of the system prompt, all the tools, the full conversation with the sub agent call breakdown where cloud code fires off sub aents, right? We can trace all the conversations of the sub aents. This is very powerful. But outside of that, we can see all the raw calls, right? So these are all the requests and the responses. You can really truly understand what cloud code is doing here by looking under the hood. This is a powerful tool to give you deeper insights on what's possible with claw code. We also have JSON debugging here all the way on the right if you just want to see the raw JSON calls and responses. In the age of agents, knowing what your tool can do can have an exponential impact on your performance because we're multiplying our impact across one or more agents. We're parallelizing our impact and we're scaling our impact up. For instance, on the channel, we've been exploring parallel sub aents, git work trees, and programmable agentic coding using cloud code, the best agentic coding tool of 2025. As usual, you know, make sure you're subscribed and you like so you don't miss out on hands-on AI coding. And now, agentic coding tips we're going to break down here, every week, every Monday. If you've been following the channel, you know how gamechanging some of these insights are, right? Even just knowing having the awareness of the sub agent task tool uh really lets you multiply what you can do, right? Investing the time to master your tools pays you back in a massive way, especially when you use the tool often and especially agentic tools that literally multiply what you can do with agents. The last repository I want to share with you here is an interesting one. It's a simple threetool MCP server called Snaphappy. There are many of these and there going to be a ton of these tools. This is simple. It has three tools. Get screenshot, take screenshot, list windows. This is a screenshot MCP server for your agent. If we paste this in, we're going to add the snapy cloud code MCP server. We have that. Now I'll type claude. And now Cloud Code has tools to let it see your desktop and interact with you in a more rich way. Now your agent can see. Let's run list open windows. There it is. Let's fire that off. And now you can see all the windows I have open right now on my screen. I have a monitor in the background here. Very cool. Let's go ahead and hide that and let's take a screenshot. I'm going to open up the author of this library here. So this is Mario's GitHub repo. And let's go and run this list open windows one more time just to make sure we get that right window positioning. The ids can change. Now this is in the context window. Now I'll say screenshot the browser. All right. And now the browser is going to map to one of these IDs. There it is. Window two. We'll hit take screenshot. There it is. So the screenshot has been saved. And you can see here this is saved in the context window of cloud code. And now I can type something like this. What are Mario's top three repos by stars? Okay. So there it is. 1 2 3 and Lemie by the way is where he has this repo. So if we look up snap happyappy we can see a couple of nested libraries. Big shout out to Lei. Let's go ahead and shout out both Lei and Simon Willis which is how I found this uh claw trace library in the first place. Finally found some time to take a look at this. Simon posted about this I think June 2nd. Yeah. So so this has been on my to checkout list for a while. Let's go ahead and screenshot the browser again. will run the same flow. List windows and screenshot the browser again. Fantastic. And then let's go ahead and shout out. Can you give a direct shout out to Bad Logic aka Mario and Simon W for great repos and great tech writeups respectively. Let's go ahead and get a a live, you know, Claude code shout out to both Mario and Simon Willison. There we go. There aren't a ton of engineers I follow closely anymore, but Simon and Mario are two of them, and I've been following Simon for quite some time now. I think it's been multiple years all the way back to the uh GPT 3.5 days. So, it's cool to see his work just continue to develop and have serious impact. I've been meaning to actually, let's just go ahead and do this right now while we're on air. Definitely check out Simon Willis. I'm going to link all this stuff for you in the description. And I've actually been meaning to just go ahead and sponsor Simon for a while now. I like how we just threw this on his website here. Sponsor and subscribe. Let's do this. Go ahead and sponsor Simon here. Fantastic. So, that's a no-brainer. Feel free to check out Simon Willis's blog here. You know, this snapshot tool is going to be one of many, right? I'm almost confident big labs are going to put out, you know, more comprehensive screenshot, screen watching tools so that cloud code is not only in the terminal, but it can also, you know, help you manage and run your device. So, more on that in the future. I think this going to be an interesting development as our AIS continue to be not just multimodal, but multifunctional and start, you know, uh, expanding into the physical world. The terminal is the great first place to strike. We see cloud code right here in the terminal. But I think you know the next place us engineers that are really leaning into a gentic engineering and a gentic coding the next place we can go is to give our tools give our agents more tools understand our impact and really try to focus on where the value is. Big shout out to Simon and big shout out to Mario here. Something incredible is happening. Our tools can do much more than we ever imagined. That means it pays big to understand your tools and maximize what they can do because every action, every keystroke is now multiplied by one or more agents. Check out these three tools link in the description and let me know what are your favorite repositories. What are some of the MCP servers you're using to take Claw Code to the next level? Stay focused and keep building.",
