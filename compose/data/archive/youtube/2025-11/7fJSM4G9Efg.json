  "raw_transcript": "you know when normal people write their New Year's resolutions and their Reflections nobody pays attention but when Sam Altman does founder of open AI everybody does so he wrote his new year's Reflections I read through them for you long story short Sam sees artificial general intelligence this year in 2025 and specifically he named The Format he thinks it will take which I think is important he hasn't said that publicly before he says it's going to look like AI AG agents that are colleagues in slack AI agents that are colleagues at work that you can partner with to get jobs done that's it that's that's what he defined as important enough and he thinks that they will do good enough work that companies will pay for them now if I were to guess he did not say this but if I were to guess I would say typically that's going to get priced in about 10% of the equivalent employee salary and before everyone says well that's the end of jobs as we know it I don't think so because these agents by definition can't do the work of an organization yet and so they do need humans around them above them below them Etc and so I think what we're going to see is just some new AI colleagues and that's what it's going to look like and it will actually be fairly minimal disruption in the short term at the same time Sam mman shared something else that's interesting he thinks that the focus of the entire business is going to shift from on the one hand running these sort of generally intelligent agents as a product maybe running Chad GPT as a product with one half of the business and then the other half is going to go back to what open AI has traditionally focused on which is research and specifically research towards super intelligence and this is something that over the holiday break various open AI Associated Affiliated working at kind of people were saying we see something we think that super intelligence is near this is sort of Sam's way of saying he sees a path to Super intelligence and typically super intelligence has been defined as an AI that can do the work of an entire organization not just one person but interestingly enough when Sam talked about it in his Reflections that wasn't the definition he focused on he might not disagree with it but what he focused on was the power of super intelligence to accelerate scientific research and I think he's really excited because he sees some of our biggest hardest problems as a species as something that super intelligence could help us solve so the classic one is aging what if super intelligence could find a solution for aging and then we wouldn't have to age and die right like that's as old as like Humanity's quest to to avoid death right like that's not new uh but Sam is thinking that super intelligence might be able to help with that there's a bunch of other ones right like uh long unsolved diseases quote unquote the cure for cancer sir um and so I think what Sam is interested in and where he hinted that open AI is going is that as they get closer to Super intelligence they're going to Pivot more into a scientific research lab and partner more with scientific institutions I think you saw a hint of that in the holiday announcements when they tipped their cap a few times on a few of those 12 days of open AI to Scientific institutions into how they help researchers I think they want to do that more um I think they want to build closer partner closer partnership links I think they want to do some scientific research themselves and I think that's something that Sam sees as a long-term Legacy for the company if he can solve some of these big problems with super intelligence he will feel like the work that he did had some meaning to it and that's something that in in our small way that's that's what we all want right uh and it's very appropriate for a New Year's reflection so there you go uh Sam thinks that general intelligence is coming this year and Sam also thinks that uh super intelligence is the next big project that open AI has he did not put a timeline on that one by the way so we'll see that by the way is my first prediction from 2025 that I got right I was very pleased with myself so I I I was guessing that we were going to get uh agents uh like in slack collaborating with our with us as colleagues um so I need to take one all the others I could still get wrong but I'll take one uh I I put that up on my substack it was fun to see that one come right in the first few days of the year all right cheers",

    "description": "My site: https://natebjones.com/\nMy links: https://linktr.ee/natebjones\nMy substack: https://natesnewsletter.substack.com/\nSam's post: https://blog.samaltman.com/reflections\n\n\nTakeaways:\n 1. AI Agents as Slack Colleagues: Sam Altman predicts AGI will emerge in 2025 as workplace AI agents integrated into Slack, working alongside humans to complete tasks collaboratively.\n 2. Minimal Workplace Disruption: Despite AGI advancements, these agents will require human oversight and collaboration, suggesting limited disruption to jobs in the near term.\n 3. OpenAI\u2019s Strategic Shift: OpenAI will split its focus between product development (e.g., ChatGPT) and advanced research into superintelligence, with the latter aimed at solving global challenges.\n 4. Superintelligence for Science: Altman highlights the potential for superintelligence to accelerate breakthroughs in aging, cancer, and other unsolved problems, emphasizing collaboration with scientific institutions.\n 5. Broadly Distributed Benefits: Altman envisions AI tools as widely accessible and beneficial, with a focus on amplifying human capabilities rather than replacing them.\n 6. Partnership-Driven Research: OpenAI is leaning toward partnerships with researchers and institutions, as seen in their holiday announcements, to align AI progress with meaningful scientific advancements.\n 7. Validation of Predictions: Altman\u2019s reflections validate prior predictions about the rise of agentic workflows, affirming the trajectory of AI integration into everyday work tools.\n\nQuotes:\n \u2022 \u201cAI agents will thrive in collaboration with humans, not in replacing them.\u201d\n \u2022 \u201cSuperintelligence has the power to solve humanity\u2019s hardest problems, from aging to curing cancer.\u201d\n \u2022 \u201cOpenAI\u2019s legacy lies in accelerating science, not just creating intelligent tools.\u201d\n\nSummary:\nSam Altman\u2019s 2025 reflections predict AGI\u2019s arrival in the workplace, manifesting as AI agents integrated into Slack to assist with tasks. He anticipates minimal job disruption, as these agents rely on human collaboration to function effectively. OpenAI\u2019s dual focus on products and superintelligence research highlights a shift toward solving global challenges, such as aging and disease. Altman envisions superintelligence as a tool to amplify scientific progress, aligning OpenAI\u2019s mission with legacy-driven outcomes. His reflections affirm the rise of agentic workflows, with OpenAI fostering partnerships to tackle meaningful problems through advanced AI.\n\nKeywords:\nAGI, superintelligence, Sam Altman, OpenAI, AI agents, Slack, ChatGPT, agentic workflows, scientific research, aging, cancer, global challenges, workplace AI, collaboration, AI integration, 2025 predictions, broadly distributed benefits, scientific partnerships, artificial intelligence",
