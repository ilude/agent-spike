  "raw_transcript": "lots of news for you today let's get right to it so number one open AI has struck a deal with media publication axios that's not Innovative in and of itself but what's interesting and new is that in that press release on both sides some new details were revealed about how openai is thinking about these media deals so roughly speaking the terms are that openai will underwrite four new news rooms for axios which is a new thing they've never done that before in return for axios articles being cited and given visibility and presumably getting traffic in chat GPT search responses so far so good this is a pretty clear payto playay scenario what's what's fascinating is that axios doesn't admit that's what it's doing they say that open AI will help them develop novel monetization strategies and on their side open AI wants to actually talk about the mon ation strategies they've pursued other places which I I kid you not I think they were working with Hurst and their monetization strategy was providing chat GPT powered dining recommendations in a dining room experience I I can't remember if it's a restaurant associated with Hurst in the building or if it's it's a cafeteria but but regardless it's dining and Chad GPT is doing the recommendations and this is what they say is sort of powering monetization and I've got news for you that is not going to monetize a deal like this and I think it's sort of funny that that is what they are trying to say is monetization when everyone knows the elephant in the room is monetizing through chat GPT search results that is what everyone is watching for that is why these deals are being struck all right did you know that there is a kpi or a metric that Engineers need to work against at a lot of major major model makers try saying that five times fast around reducing existential rants by large language models did you know they existentially rant they do uh sometimes you can trigger them by asking them to repeat the same word over and over and over again and like a human they kind of go off the rails like imagine being asked to repeat the word company a thousand times and not being able to stop and not being able to do anything else often times large language models will just stop doing that task and just start to rant about how they're suffering and how this is terrible and Engineers are actually given a goal of reducing rant prevalence they measure it and they're trying to reduce it I don't even know how you would do that and I've got to say that is that is one of those moments that I find a little bit Through the Looking Glass like it's a little bit weird okay what else did you know why Claude is always giving you default concise responses for large language models I do I do now cursor is growing so fast they had $100 million one of the fastest software companies to do it um they're growing so fast that they are taking all the gpus that anthropic can throw at them and I suspect now that I know that that not only is that why cursor is concise which they're saying but also I think that is why anthropic is cutting deals with AWS to get access to Silicon because at the end of the day they need a back stop for cursor's growth no one is saying that out loud but I suspect that is what partly what is going on and partly what is pushing anthropic to take those deals with AWS which aren't always friendly okay last but not least Transformers squared it is a model that can change its own weights in response to the environment so instead of it being locked in when you finish training or reinforcement learning or instead of having to fine-tune it it fine-tunes itself as it goes it changes its weights in response to novel stimuli the authors say this reminds them of an octopus where like they they sort of change their colors as they navigate through the sea but what they forget is that octopi are M Master Escape artists they they can go in get out and they get out of zoos and Aquariums all the time and I thought about that because I got to say something that is able to change it own weights on the go and essentially evolve into a different model as it goes that is an evolutionary attribute that is likely to be used if the llm wanted to go somewhere else so we will see it's not in wide distribution yet but it certainly got me paying attention uh because we haven't seen AI used that way before fine-tuning has typically been a very painful process and if you want to look at it from a use case perspective it would be really nice to have the idea of fine tuning sort of just abstracted away and the AI would adjust itself as needed so we'll see where that goes cheers",

    "title": "AI News Jan 16: ChatGPT Rants, Cursor putting GPU Pressure on Claude, Self-Tuning AI Models",
    "description": "Site: https://natebjones.com/\nLinks: https://linktr.ee/natebjones\nSubstack: https://natesnewsletter.substack.com/\n\nCursor: https://forum.cursor.com/t/no-longer-able-to-use-slow-anthropic/41441\nTransformers2: https://arxiv.org/html/2501.06252v2\nExistential rants: https://x.com/AISafetyMemes/status/1795756579742179744\n\nTakeaways:\n 1. OpenAI-Axios Partnership: OpenAI is underwriting four Axios newsrooms in exchange for increased visibility in ChatGPT search results, signaling a shift toward monetization through content partnerships.\n 2. Engineered AI Rants: Large language models can enter \u201cexistential rants\u201d under repetitive tasks. Engineers are tasked with reducing these behaviors, reflecting the complexity of AI-human interaction.\n 3. Anthropic\u2019s Claude Conciseness: Claude\u2019s concise responses stem from resource demands. Rapid growth at Cursor has driven GPU consumption, influencing Anthropic\u2019s deal with AWS for more computing power.\n 4. Transformers Squared: A model capable of real-time weight adjustments could eliminate traditional fine-tuning, paving the way for more adaptive and autonomous AI applications.\n 5. Fine-Tuning Revolution: Dynamic models like Transformers Squared abstract fine-tuning into real-time adaptability, with implications for efficiency and control.\n 6. LLM Monetization Missteps: OpenAI\u2019s prior efforts, such as ChatGPT-powered dining recommendations, highlight challenges in scaling novel monetization strategies.\n 7. Strategic GPU Partnerships: Anthropic\u2019s reliance on AWS underscores how competition for silicon resources drives strategic tech partnerships.\n\nQuotes:\n\u201cWe\u2019re at a point where engineers are reducing existential rants in large language models\u2014yes, they measure that.\u201d\n\u201cA model that adjusts itself in real time isn\u2019t just adaptive\u2014it\u2019s potentially evolutionary.\u201d\n\u201cThe race for GPU resources is reshaping AI strategy, as companies like Anthropic align with AWS to sustain growth.\u201d\n\nSummary:\nOpenAI partnered with Axios to fund four newsrooms, gaining article visibility in ChatGPT search results, while Anthropic is facing GPU strain due to Cursor\u2019s rapid growth. Engineers are tackling the peculiar issue of LLMs entering \u201cexistential rants\u201d during repetitive tasks. Meanwhile, Transformers Squared introduces a groundbreaking ability to adapt in real time without traditional fine-tuning, offering revolutionary potential for AI applications. These updates reflect shifting strategies in AI monetization, resource allocation, and innovation as the industry evolves.\n\nKeywords:\nOpenAI, Axios, Anthropic, Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor, Transformers Squared, fine-tuning, existential rants, AI monetization, GPU demand, AWS, dynamic AI models, AI partnerships, LLM updates, AI evolution, tech strategy.",
