  "raw_transcript": "with the release of the GPT store open AI is taking incremental steps toward owning the generative AI space with ugc on AGC what is ugc what is AG and what does the GPT store mean for you and I as Engineers that's what we're going to break down in this video whenever new technology is released great Engineers ask themselves is this worth my time is this worth your time there are a million things that require your time and attention why should you pay attention to this with the gbt store it's pretty clear that it's a rough first draft the search functionality is limited sometimes results don't load there are errors all over the place and most of these gpts are thin wrappers around docks right thin wrappers around some documentation that you would normally just go visit there's nothing wrong with that but there's nothing special about that either throughout all the mess and the hype around the GPT store there are three hyper compelling value propositions that gpts offer you if you understand the macro and micro picture of the GPT store and one of these three value ads has a potential to take your engineering and your products to the next level so let's talk about this announcement post and how you can utilize this opportunity to improve your engineering tools and products so from a macro perspective there are four things that are absolutely clear open AI is leading the AI race open AI is building the next app store on top of gpts open AI is building an ecosystem that anyone can tap into not just Engineers this is really important we're going to circle back to this in a moment open AI is taking smart midsized incremental steps toward owning the generative AI space with ugc on AGC so we're going to talk about exactly what that means in a second here but first let's talk about how open AI is differentiating the gbt store from the Apple Store so in announcement posts every sentence matters if you've worked with or seen the marketing segment of companies you know this is true every sentence matters every sentence is double and triple checked against the company's Mission and the immediate business targets I think one phrase from this post is very telling let me show you exactly what I mean so if we look for this include your GPT in the store yeah so if we look at this section here include your GPT in the store building your own GPT is simple and doesn't require any coding skills so what is the macro message here from open AI they're building a platform open to anyone interested in using AI not just Engineers so like let's dig into that some more right from a business perspective what does that mean they're trying to open up their Tam total addressable Market us Engineers although we've grown in size as a group over over the past you know 10 years we engineers make up a fraction of the population by opening up the GPT store to everyone they do something the Apple Store could never do the Apple Store is constricted to engineers and not just any Engineers Engineers that can code Objective C Swift and react native like languages exclusively right gpts on the other hand are making a big play they're saying this doesn't require any coding skills this is a big deal and it has implications but I want to call this out and say a bigger Pool isn't a better pool which leads us to the advantage that you and I have here true engineers and true professionals care about their craft they understand the tools that they need to use to build the thing they're trying to build if you're watching this channel I'll bet you are one of these true Engineers one of these true professionals and if you're not you probably will be this care and love of your craft leads you to build High high quality products tools applications and experiences in app store for anyone to build on means there's going to be a hilarious amount of junk and useless gpts so this has three major implications the last one being the most important for you so it means there's going to be more filtering work right we're going to have to shift through the bad gpts especially as open AI improves their search capabilities adds tagging Etc it also means though great applications will stand out even more because there'll be a dime and a dozen and a c of gpts so the great gpts will likely rise to the top very quickly and lastly Engineers have a explicit sizable advantage in building great gpts again if you've been with the channel if you've been experimenting with gpts llms and agents you understand the limits pros and cons of what gpts can do and having that Engineers mindset in general of building something from the ground up understanding that technology understanding what these gpts can do is going to give you a sizable advantage in building your GPT so let's jump back to the last macro point this is really important and it really affects everyone from the top down open AI is taking smart midsize incremental steps toward owning the generative AI space with ugc on AGC so let's break this down right what is ugc user generated content think Tik Tok videos think IG posts think Reddit feed think any feed that exists that users are creating the users are the product this was a brilliant innovation of the companies in the 2010s led by Facebook they figured out we can let our users generate content for our users we can manage their generated content do less work and then throw ads in between our user generated content right this is the model of the current web and you see it everywhere ugc plays on the idea of the fundamental Drive of human connectivity right we want to see what everyone else is doing we want to connect with others we want to be aware of what everyone's posting sharing and connecting on right that's ugc users are generating the content that drives the platform but things are going to a new level with ugc on AGC AGC of course is AI generated content sometimes referred to as AIG GC we're not quite at the point where we have true agentic systems autogenerating their own content follow the channel if you're interested in true agentic systems the goal of this channel is to lead the journey toward becoming agentic Engineers a new role that builds systems that build systems I'm betting my career on it and all you have to do to join and learn is hit subscribe it really helps out the channel and it helps more Engineers just like you stay close to the future of engineering as I spend tons and tons of my time in energy researching experimenting and pushing what we can do with this technology so we're not quite there with these gentic systems but it's coming right now we need that human intervention and open AI is pulling the most clutch business move by combining ugc and putting it on top of AGC they're opening up the app store for us the user to generate units of AGC right these units right now are called gpts they'll then take our gpts give us some of the revenue share and host and share these reusable units of ugc in the form of ACCC right our individual gpts honestly it's a brilliant move from a business perspective and it was bound to happen at some point it's super clutch that open AI is making this happen so let's talk about what that means for you the engineer so on the micro side what's the best move for us how can we not only stay relevant but increase our capacity to deliver valuable products should you be spinning out gpts should you be constantly hunting for the best gpts or should you wait until the death is settled before committing your precious time and energy as most things in engineering I think the answer is it depends but I'm leaning more toward action here if you're watching this video you know about gpts maybe you've used open AI apis maybe you know about agents and multi-agent systems you're ahead of the curve I know it might not be apparent but there's a huge chunk of Engineers who are blatantly ignoring how useful generative AI is or they just haven't taken the time and you've probably heard about companies that are straight up Banning the use of AI and open AI related technology I can guarantee you they're going to Pivot over the next couple years or they're going out of business so you're in the right place on the micro level I think the best move is the following cut out an hour of time to find one or two gpts you find useful get a good feel for it figure out where the bounds are see what it can do see what it can't do and then think about how would you improve it lastly as you're going on about your day writing code Building Products think about gpts that you could use to accelerate your engineering try to find the GPT that you're thinking of and if you can't maybe it's time to start building a GPT of your own it's important to reiterate the value proposition of gpts right it really comes in three forms domain specific custom knowledge bases this is information you can feed your gpts your assistant or your agent we've done this on the channel via the assistance API domain specific language is what gives gpts and really if you think about it it's what makes all of us valuable right it's what we know that others don't or it's skills we have that others don't have the second form of value that GPT offers you is the message threads right it's the trailing context it's the conversation that you've been having with it over time right it understands and can refer to the Past in a decent enough way that makes it valuable and then lastly and this is the most important one gpts have the ability to take action AKA make API requests if there's anywhere I recommend on focusing it's building hyp specific custom apis that do special unique things around your domain around your product so what exactly do I mean by that let me give you a specific example that I'm personally considering so I'm working on a text to SQL to results application and the idea is simple stop wasting your time writing SQL let natural language queries do the hard work for us you can do everything from simple lookup statements simple selects in natural language and then you can take that to the next level and in just a few words make queries that would take you possibly hours to complete this deceptively simple query average time between jobs is a lot of work and you can see here we wrote four words and the SQL it generated did everything we needed to without any of the hassle without any of the time the headaches it takes to write SQL I'm building this tool and I'm thinking about creating a GPT that wires up to your talk to your database desktop application that's going to make queries on your behalf right from the GPT store it will update your desktop application in real time it's going to make queries you know right in the application as you're typing it adds an additional conversational layer as a completely separate feature that also integrates really well with the core value proposition that the text to SQL to results application talk to your database is going to deliver this is one way that I'm looking at gpts thinking about how can I create real valuable products with it how can I integrated into applications I'm building you can think about the potential of gpts as a percentage I see API actions being long-term 80 to 90% of the true value of gpts the fact that they can connect to your system via apis and do literally anything I really see as the long-term value of gpts if you're interested you can check out the Prototype of talk to your database Link in the description and if you find it interesting there's a crazy 50% deal on the agentic plan on the upgrade plan up until the 20th for the desktop application that's going to launch at the end of the month I'm really excited and committed to building the best text to SQL to result application to the desktop of developers who are writing SQL burning up a ton of time so what do you think about this macro and micro strategy do you agree do you disagree let me know in the comments I think open AI is making some incredible strategic moves while giving ample opportunity to Engineers to be a big part of the picture even with gpts targeting everyone I think it almost creates this reverse Advantage for engineers to really build something differentiated something really focused something really unique with all this I recommend you lean toward action toward experimentation and look for those small to midsize ways that you can use gpts to accelerate your engineering I will admit that this takes time you have to shift through some of the gpts you have to learn the GPT action API that's something that I'm going to be spending a decent amount of time on myself so that I can properly integrate them with talk to database and every application that I'm going to be building next I think it's a good bet in terms of where to spend your time it's a good place to experiment if it is going to be the next Apple Store you want to get in here early right you and I have a unique advantage of understanding this technology at a lower level where we can get in there create value and ship it maybe you missed the internet boom maybe you missed Facebook apps maybe you missed the social wave maybe you missed the App Store but you're here for the GPT store let's take advantage of this let's make sure we're exploring and experimenting at least 10 to 30% of our time and let's just see what can happen with these gpts right the future is agentic applications and GPT s seem to be on a critical path toward discoverability of useful agents they're also Holding Center Stage in the platform where it seems like the future of AI agents and agentic software may live if you enjoy this video and you want to stay on the edge of AI charged engineering drop the like drop the sub and I'll see you in the next one",
