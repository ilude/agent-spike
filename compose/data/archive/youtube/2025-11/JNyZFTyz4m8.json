  "raw_transcript": "in 10 minutes i'm going to show you guys how you can add sweet animations to your vue.js apps let's get into it i'm going to go ahead and paste this in this is just a new blank vite view ts application cdn there and yarn add we're going to do view use last motion so let's get this library installed uh while that's installing let's go ahead and add support for it in the application so let's open main ts and we'll add uh let's say use motion i believe it's the create plugin whatever they say motion plugin so motion plug-in here and we'll go ahead and just use this on our view app and that should be good let's go ahead and run the yarn let's change this to fetching an object and let's see where we're at cool so we have our new app here and let's go ahead and get rid of all the boilerplate checking the vojs there's this and we'll just clear this out and add our header tag so vgs and you use motion okay cool so first things first now that we have the app set up let me show you guys kind of what exactly we'll be creating so this is my personal website my blog and you can see i have i'm using view motion here i've got these cool floating effects um on these card components that show off kind of what i'm building um this is really cool right so you can see they're just floating here on repeat and if we continue to scroll you'll see that every blog will actually fade in when it's time for them to right so when when they're in the uh the view they'll go ahead and scroll in so that's pretty cool um and if we look closer here you can see that every button is actually glowing with their kind of theme color right so that's kind of cool and that's some of the effects we'll be looking into today so first things first the easiest way to get set up with view use motion is to use their presets just go ahead and create a tag here for their presets um this will be presets and let's just paste this in and this div will fade in so as you can see here we added about two three lines of code and on refresh here um this div is fading in so that's really cool um they have a bunch of presets uh for you to get with to get started with super quickly let's go ahead and try a couple more so we'll use this roll left this div will roll left and this is going to look kind of wonky because it's just a div but you can see it's kind of you know rolling in some of the more i think slicker ones are the the pops are pretty good but the slides the slides are really i think pretty common and pretty good looking so let's go ahead and do a slide we'll do a slide laptop looks good just going to slide left throw that in here fix the closing div this div will slide left so you can see nice and clean it's going to slide left and you know you can imagine this on on your own site you know you want these to fade in uh to draw attention to them or just to make the site look clean um you know these are pretty cool so those are presets they have a bunch of those the problem with presets is that you know they're all opinionated they're all kind of finished um but vmotion of course lets you customize the crap out of your own so let's go ahead and look at an example of a custom motion so let me just copy this create a new h tag custom motions and we'll just paste this div in and give it some content this is a custom animation cool so you can see um we have these uh properties here um or html attributes rather so uh initial and enter and these are called variants in the motion world so they basically specify what the styles should be during a specific state right so um initial is where we start and enter is where we go after the component has entered the view right so this is taking y 100 which is going to be below its native position and then we're going to go to zero and it's going to take the opacity from zero and go to opacity one right so if we refresh on this zoom in a little bit if we refresh on this you can see that happens comes from the bottom bottom up and fades in so it's really cool right so we can tweak this we can make this 200 so we'll come in from the bottom further and we can even do more with this right so they have this idea of transitions and we can add a duration here and we can do things like um yeah we can modify the easing but let's just go ahead with transitions first so um that's that so what do i do wrong here why are we going to complain transition yeah it's just transition and now you can see i bumped the transition to transition duration to two seconds and that's going to take its sweet time from the view um so that's pretty cool um but you can imagine uh as you're stacking up all your motions and your um you know animations you don't want to just toss them all in the div like this so um the pattern i've been using is to create a new file called motions and then we can go ahead and export you know motion fade up so essentially what you do is you can create your own module with all of these different motions and let me just go ahead and style this initial or format this see okay cool so that looks good and then what you can do is set this equal to um motion fade up right and then we can import this at the top motions motion fade up and as you can see we now have this reusable module uh to you know set up all of our animations so that's pretty cool uh let's dive into some of the motions i use for my site and some of the emotions that you know you can use um so let's go ahead and look at uh glow text right so kind of same idea let's create a p tag this text will glow and let's go ahead and set up a vmotion here motion glow text so let's go ahead and set this up we'll just export a new motion glow text we'll copy all this code here paste and then we'll set up the rules so a couple things we'll need here we'll want uh text uh yup text shadow thank you co-pilot and that'll just go ahead and start us out at zero i'll go ahead and move this to one pixel and then i'll make the duration half a second and then we'll need that shadow here let's go ahead and bump this up to 10. make it more obvious and we'll make this glow a green color let's go ahead and set that there a couple additional transition properties we want um what's it called repeat infinity so it's going to keep running and then repeat type on to reverse so that means when it gets to the end it's going to reverse its animation so we can get that cool glow effect so let's go ahead and take a look at this if we get our glow mess something up let's see what i did i just need to import of course cool so as you can see we have glowing text it's moving kind of quickly so i'm going to drop it down from 500 to 1 second and so that's pretty awesome so we have glowing text there and let's go ahead and create a couple more so there's glow text let's do a button glow and you know for button we'll just change this to block shadow and everything else should be about the same so let's go ahead and copy this i'll do button glow and drop a button in and the motion equals motion button glow cool and of course we got to import and let's see we get there okay of course we want some content in here click me and as you can see we have button below so that's really cool let's go ahead and do one more before we run out of time here we'll do a div shake div shape so change this to motion uh shake um i'm shaking i'll turn this through div pretty cool let's go ahead and get the import and let's quickly code up a shake so motion shake let's copy we'll copy our first one here and paste that in and what do we need here let's go ahead and just do like an x 0 and then we'll do an x 10 and then we'll copy in our transition because we do want to loop and we'll do a little shorter time frame here and let's see how this looks cool so you can see the dip's shaking a little bit we're out of time here but i think you get the general idea right super customizable really quick and the way i have this set up you can quickly create objects and export so yeah that was a quick tutorial for you guys on view use motion super cool vue.js animation library [Music] you",
