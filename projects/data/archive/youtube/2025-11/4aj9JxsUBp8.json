  "raw_transcript": "We need to have the skill to know when to stop building the product. And that is new because AI will tell you over and over and over and over again, you can build more. You can add a database. You can add a customer relationship manager. You can add a new product. Expand, expand, expand, expand. You need to be able to say no. Before, because software was so expensive, you had to cut just to sort of find a way to make it work. Now software is so cheap, it's very tempting to add and add and add an ad. You are the one that has to develop the skill to say no. You have to say this is a night and weekend project. This is the only thing I need to build to show that I can solve the problem. That discipline is something that was imposed by external cost controls before. Not anymore. Now it's on you. Now it's a skill you have to have. Know when to say no. as really really important.",
