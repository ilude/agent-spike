  "raw_transcript": "We need to have the skill to know when to stop building the product. And that is new because AI will tell you over and over and over and over again, you can build more. You can add a database. You can add a customer relationship manager. You can add a new product. Expand, expand, expand, expand. You need to be able to say no. Before, because software was so expensive, you had to cut just to sort of find a way to make it work. Now software is so cheap, it's very tempting to add and add and add an ad. You are the one that has to develop the skill to say no. You have to say this is a night and weekend project. This is the only thing I need to build to show that I can solve the problem. That discipline is something that was imposed by external cost controls before. Not anymore. Now it's on you. Now it's a skill you have to have. Know when to say no. as really really important.",

    "description": "What\u2019s really happening with building an AI-powered side gig?\nThe usual advice is super generic: \"AI makes building a side gig easier than ever\"\u2014sure. \n\nBut HOW? What's the actual advantage now? Why? How do YOU leverage that advantage to build an AI side gig that actually stands a chance of making money?\n\nIn this video, I share the inside scoop on launching an AI-native side gig that actually ships:\n\u2022 Why LLMs open a short-lived micro-niche window\u2014and how to spot it.\n\u2022 How to choose distribution-first micro markets you already know and serve.\n\u2022 What tool stack ships fast: Lovable.dev, Outseta, Framer, Gemini\u2014no heroics.\n\u2022 Where to draw the line: ruthless scope, square-deal pricing, real traction.\n\nFor solo builders, the window is real but short; choose a niche you know, keep scope tight, and let distribution\u2014not features\u2014decide.\n\nSubscribe for daily AI strategy and news.\nFor deeper playbooks and analysis: https://natesnewsletter.substack.com/",
