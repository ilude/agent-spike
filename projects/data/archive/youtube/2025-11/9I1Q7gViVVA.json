You have agents that are LLMs with tools and guidance in a simulated world. That's the last part. And that's why the simulation matters so much with the warehouse that Jensen introduced. Every other example we have of model building simulates the world. Now, it might not be like a 3D video game world simulation. It might be a simulation that models the relevant constraints of the world in text in words. That can happen too. And all you have to do, like we we do this all the time, there are prompts that will set up your LLM to act as an agent within a reality simulator. And all you're doing is telling the agent to act in a certain way with this policy and guidance given these constraints around the",

    "description": "My site: https://natebjones.com\nMy substack: https://natesnewsletter.substack.com/\nThe story: https://open.substack.com/pub/natesnewsletter/p/the-complete-141-page-guide-to-ai?r=1z4sm5&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&showWelcomeOnShare=true\n\nTakeaways\n 1. Execution vs. Modeling: Most teams obsess over agents that do\u2014writing emails or closing tickets\u2014but the real leverage is in agents that model complex realities and guide better decisions.\n 2. The Missing Layer: Simulation: Add a simulated world to the classic \u201cLLM + tools + guidance\u201d stack and you transform an agent from a task-runner into a reality simulator\u2014think digital twins that explore futures before you spend a dollar.\n 3. Exponential Value Levers: Alternate-timeline exploration, time compression (iteration #300 while rivals hit #3), and compounding insights create nonlinear payoffs unattainable with pure automation.\n 4. Proof in the Wild: Renault cuts vehicle-dev time 60 %, BMW optimizes factories overnight, F1 refines pit strategy in real time, and ad networks pre-test creative mixes\u2014all by simulating before executing.\n 5. Handling Objections: \u201cGarbage in, garbage out\u201d is solvable with calibration loops; simulations bound distributions rather than forecast points; compute costs pale beside breakthrough potential; culture must reward decision quality, not just shipped features.\n 6. Start Small, Scale Fast: Twin a single KPI, feed clean data, refresh and back-test continuously, and layer dependable tooling. Early movers in modeling gain a first-mover edge while others chase incremental automation gains.\n\nQuotes\n\u201cWe\u2019re pouring tokens into agents that shave minutes, yet the trillion-dollar edge is compressing ten-year strategies into ten-hour sims.\u201d\n\u201cAgents in trench coats doing tasks are linear; agents in simulated worlds are exponential.\u201d\n\u201cIf we now have compute for clear foresight, choosing not to use it becomes a moral failure.\u201d\n\nSummary\nI argue that the community fixates on agents as doers\u2014LLMs plus tools closing tickets\u2014while the real opportunity is agents as modelers. By adding a simulated world, we turn agents into digital twins that explore alternate timelines, compress months of learning into hours, and compound insights over iterations. Examples from Renault, BMW, Formula One, and ad tech prove the payoff. Objections about accuracy, overconfidence, cost, and culture are addressable with calibration loops, probabilistic thinking, and incentive shifts. The playbook: pick one KPI, feed quality data, establish feedback loops, and iterate. Those who master simulation will outpace pure automation players.\n\nKeywords\nAI agents, digital twins, simulation, modeling beats doing, alternate timelines, time compression, compounding insights, decision quality, KPI twinning, calibration loops, Renault, BMW, Formula One, ad creative simulation",
