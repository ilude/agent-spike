  "raw_transcript": "So executives tend to ask me, Nate, which model should we bet on for AI agents? Wrong question, guys. The right question is which architecture delivers the workflows we're looking for. Model advantage lasts maybe a quarter at best. Architectural advantage is something that persists for years. So the principle is this. You want to build model agnostic orchestration that isn't dependent on particular models to execute particular workflows. In particular, you want to make sure that your agents are selected, evaluated, swapped, and combined individually. And you do that based on the architecture and what it demands, the workflows, right? This comes back to your orchestration layer being the competitive bet, not the models. The models are replaceable commodities. You can build a model orchestration layer and that is going to get you much much farther.",

What I hear too often from companies without agents is that agents are early. Not true. Fortune 100 companies are using them now and delivering hundreds of millions in value.\n\nThey're already delivering ROI at scale.\n\nIn this video, I share the inside scoop on building agentic systems that last:\n\u2022 Why architecture-first orchestration beats model-first bets\n\u2022 How compounding memory creates unclosable advantages\n\u2022 What workflows to automate for measurable business outcomes\n\u2022 Where compliance and vertical context become durable moats\n\nChapters:\n00:00 The Urgency of AI Agents\n02:40 Principles for Building AI Agents\n05:36 Workflows and ROI in AI Automation\n08:04 Vertical Defensibility in AI Solutions\n11:07 Compliance as a Competitive Advantage\n13:44 The Importance of Velocity in AI Deployment\n\nIf you lead teams, the takeaway is simple: move fast on agentic orchestration now to bank learning and velocity\u2014wait, and you\u2019ll face widening gaps you can\u2019t buy back later.\n\nSubscribe for daily AI strategy and news.\nFor deeper playbooks and analysis: https://natesnewsletter.substack.com/",
