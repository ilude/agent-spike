  "raw_transcript": "two pieces of AI news that I think matter and one that doesn't the one that doesn't first I don't think open AI search is going to go down as a massive uh Innovation they already search they're searching in advanced voice mode that's really the end of it I think it's helpful but it's not that big a piece of news but two things I think that are big that aren't getting the headlines they should one is the way Clara is handling their hiring practices and automating AI conversation I think a poor example of how to handle a delicate situation and I think it's driven by Claro's business performance and their pressure to IPO and we're going to talk about it briefly and then I'll get to Ilia suer and his speech at the nors conference in Vancouver after that so first Clara fundamentally Clara is trying to recover their valuation from 2021 when they were at $45 billion that is what the lens you should use for everything they do they're currently valued at 14 billion they obviously have a long way to go value compression is just a reality for most companies that had a valuation in 2021 part of why Clara is being so aggressive then with their claims about automating away Salesforce and now uh today automating away uh 2,000 jobs I think that's fine like they're they're going to make those claims because they want to impress investors with their efficiency in a low margin by now pay later business with a a lot of bad debt it makes a ton of sense for them business-wise to argue that they're extremely efficient because it defends their margin and it helps them project defensive margin when they're looking to IPO that doesn't mean that it's actually as substantive as they claim that remains to be seen it is possible that Clara will end up aing automating away a significant part of their workflow they have unlike many SAS providers very defined business logic they have very clear product requirements it's actually one of the lower ambiguity SAS businesses out there you buy now you pay later like there's a lot of detail in bad debt and how you manage bad debt I've looked at that briefly in another Walk of Life but overall from a business perspective it's one of the clearer playbooks to run so I could see if they really wanted to commit to it that it might be one of the earlier places where you start to see some labor replacement with AI Etc but what I don't appreciate is CLA claiming they are already doing this when their actual jobs page doesn't reflect that reality they are saying they've paused hiring for example but you can find 54 open positions on Clara's website right now and on LinkedIn and they're not they're not meaningless positions they're hiring senior software Engineers so if you're going to claim that you are pausing hiring and then publicly not live up to that promise I think it's right for people to ask questions about why you're making such aggressive statements when the reality doesn't live up to what you're claiming so I think that the reason I call this out is strategic is that in 2025 we are going to see a lot more statements from companies that feel like clar's statement because it's going to be very fashionable for companies to claim huge gains from AI efficiencies we need to ask where the reality is we need to ask where people are actually delivering gains with AI in production versus where they are making a PR statement and right now it's really difficult to see what clar is actually delivering and we're just going to have to wait and see and I think that the lesson I take away from this is to be a little bit skeptical about AI automation claims and jobs heading into 2025 it's like prove it right moving on to number two moving on to Ilia and his speech at norp in Vancouver so Ilia is the grandfather of AI not the only one there's a lot of people who can make that claim and IL is a young guy so he's he much less gray than me but he has been instrumental in building AI he was a co-founder at open AI he has been uh critical to the development of large language models since 2014 so they invited him back a decade later at NPS to reflect on sort of how things have come this far what's up ahead very classic thing right and now he's a Founder at safe super intelligence so he is intimately involved in building a motion to Super intelligence which is usually defined as uh an intelligence that is great enough to run an entire organization's worth of value through AI without any people whatsoever so imagine like your startup of 200 is just an AI so he comes and mostly what people report on is his quote that the internet is like oil it's a non-renewable resource we've already used it for pre-training and it's gone and so people talk about that right and that's his it's framed as his comment on the great uh pre-training controversy where we are wondering if we're hitting a pre- training wall Google fires back today and says we're not hitting a pre-training wall that's only if you don't have imagination and we we will have to see how that all plays out I want to call out something that I think people overlooked Ilia has had opinions in the past about what's just ahead they're not is correct especially in terms of sequencing it's very difficult to get the future right sequentially it's easier to get it right conceptually if you deeply know your field he deeply knows the field and so if you look at past statements about how large language models will progress he's often conceptually correct but he has been so hesitant about what's ahead and that came out at NPS it's like this moment past with Chad GPT and reaching gp4 level now 01 and the sense that nobody really talked about that that I got from Ila's talk is that he's not sure what's ahead for the first time in a long time and I think that's worth talking about that's a story and he he hazarded some guesses about how we get to Super intelligence but for the founder of safe super intelligence to really publicly not be sure about the next step forward is a remarkable thing from the money graph on his presentation I think his bet is on recursive AI self-improvement but that's very unproven and the money graph by the way is this like line chart where he basically calls out that intelligence and brain size in mammals are somewhat correlated except for hominids us and we have found a way to hack our wetwear hack our brains so that we are able to have intelligence that scales that isn't linearly linked to brain size great love that it's a very astute observation but it's an analogy it's not exactly clear how that would map to artificial intelligence and Ilia made it pretty clear that he's not sure yet either now it is possible he is concealing Alpha right he has some special Insight on this that is the founder of safe super intelligence he's going to keep to himself until he can prove it that's a possibility but my sense is he's actually trying to figure out the way forward with the rest of us and that's going to make for a very interesting 2025 because there's a lot of candidates there's people who are saying extra test time extra inference time when you type in your chat is going to help us really scale intelligence there's people saying synthetic data is the way forward and we don't need an internet's worth of data for pre-t trading because the llms can generate their data now there's people who are saying that it's about logic which is something that ilot tipped his cap to in the presentation saying that if we can teach machines to be logical we have a path forward this feels like a hinge moment it feels like the beginning of 2025 is one of those inflection points where there's multiple paths into the future and some of the leading model makers and some of the leading thinkers in the space are still trying to figure out what is a path toward the next step change in intelligence and what does it look like we shall see I'm excited to find out but those are things that I think are more strategic versus the open AI search stuff which made headlines I hope you enjoyed this cheers",

    "description": "About me: https://natebjones.com/\nMy links: https://linktr.ee/natebjones\nIlya: https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/13/24320811/what-ilya-sutskever-sees-openai-model-data-training\nKlarna: https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/14/klarnas-ceo-says-it-stopped-hiring-thanks-to-ai-but-still-advertises-many-open-positions/\n\nTakeaways:\n 1. PR-Driven Automation Claims: Klarna\u2019s assertions about AI-driven job cuts appear aimed at boosting investor confidence ahead of a potential IPO rather than reflecting actual automation progress.\n 2. Hiring Reality Check: Despite announcing a hiring pause, Klarna still lists over 50 active job openings, including senior roles, casting doubt on its automation narrative.\n 3. Automation Skepticism in 2025: As more companies boast AI-driven efficiencies, separating PR-driven claims from real operational improvements will become increasingly critical.\n 4. Ilya\u2019s Cautious Outlook: Ilya Sutskever expressed rare uncertainty about AI\u2019s future breakthroughs, signaling a pivotal moment for the AI industry.\n 5. Future AI Paths: Potential AI advancement paths include recursive self-improvement, logical reasoning enhancements, and synthetic data generation, though none have proven scalable.\n 6. Data as a Finite Resource: Sutskever\u2019s comparison of the internet to a \u2018non-renewable resource\u2019 for pre-training highlights a critical challenge in AI research.\n\nQuotes:\n\u201cWe need to ask where people are actually delivering gains with AI in production versus where they are making a PR statement.\u201d\n\u201cIt feels like the beginning of 2025 is one of those inflection points where there are multiple paths into the future.\u201d\n\u201cFor the founder of Safe Superintelligence to publicly not be sure about the next step forward is a remarkable thing.\u201d\n\nSummary:\nKlarna\u2019s AI automation claims seem like PR-driven messaging aimed at investors, with active hiring contradicting its job-cut narrative. As AI automation hype intensifies, companies must prove real gains. At NeurIPS, Ilya Sutskever shared uncertainty about AI\u2019s next leap despite exploring possibilities like recursive self-improvement and synthetic data generation. His acknowledgment of limited clarity on future advancements underscores an inflection point in AI\u2019s development, setting the stage for breakthroughs\u2014or recalibrations\u2014in 2025.\n\nKeywords:\nKlarna, AI automation, IPO strategy, Ilya Sutskever, Safe Superintelligence, recursive self-improvement, AI research, NeurIPS, synthetic data, AI job cuts, pre-training wall, AI industry future",
