  "raw_transcript": "AI news today we've got a bunch of fun ones for you it's just never old uh I like to talk about actual applications of AI and I think it's really interesting to see them in a medical setting because those are really high stakes you have to get them right Mayo Clinic has published two different use cases for AI recently that I wanted to call out one is developing an AI model for automated Radiology workflows which I'm not super surprised by because there's been a lot of anecdotal reporting of how good large language models are at reading x-ray images and so what they've done is they've used it to uh build report generation into the X-ray workflow they're using it for tube and line placement for evaluation which is super interesting um and they're looking at change detection in chest x-rays which fits right in with the anecdotes but there's a difference here right like it's one thing to have like some bro on X say you know I got this x-ray looked at and look at what grock did or look at what Chad GPT did it's another to have Mayo clinics say this is good enough that we're actually going to build it in and so I think that's a moment the other thing they're working on is they're working with Azure on combining Human Genome data with Mayo's exome data sets and they're basically looking at how can they build a reference sort of perfect Human Genome and I know that like that sounds like the start of a sci-fi movie so we're just going to pass over that part um but they're looking to build build essentially a reference data set around the human genome with Azure that they can then use when they look at genome variance to build personalized medicine that when the details are somewhat sketchy on I could not tell you exactly how they are using AI to scale personalization except that in general the compute for personalization has been really difficult to do and AI is often able to figure out personalized relationships faster because a lot of what underneath the hood is going on as Transformers are are running these comparisons between tokens and building token relationships might be what's happening that's speculation uh I'll be curious to learn more about what they're doing with their genomic Foundation model number three huo is doing uh a model huo is a Chinese model maker they're they introduced their Minimax model it's a 4 million token context window so it's quite large and it has perfect recall this is now the second long context window perfect recall feature that I have seen in the last two days and there's a third one that I'm going to mention now which is the Chad GPT in beta for some users is now rolling out Advanced um how do I want to put it Advanced memory it's not clear if Advanced memory means it remembers better or if it remembers more but it's happening and so to me like when I look at these different bullet points the Hua Minimax model that came out the work that's been done on Titans at Google and now this release by Chad GPT I think that we're seeing the dotted lines toward one of the themes for 2025 which is solving the memory problem um I would expect a lot more releases along those lines in the next couple of months number four uh you probably know this uh but I think it's worth calling out because it's another actual launch at scale Reddit has gotten llm search to be good enough that they feel good about launching Reddit answers which is an AI powered Search tool it provides curated conversational insights from reddit's discussions what's interesting to me is Reddit chose to take their time with this one like they could have been like Google Google rushed their uh AI summaries to Market they got panned for it Reddit took their time and it makes me wonder if the Reddit AI answers is actually going to be a higher quality experience for users versus Google because they took the time on the quality so I'd be curious for your thoughts there last but not least we have what I would call the rumor mill um so there's three things that are being rumored to be produced by open a or shipped by openai by by January 30th one is the 03 model which they've announced but not released one is the ever elusive project oion no one really knows what that is some people thinks that think that's GPT 5 which would be a new pre-trained class of language model bigger than gp4 uh but that's speculation at this point um and then the third thing that people think they're going to release is something farther on agents so not just scheduled tasks but um an entire class of Agents that we think they will call operators it's speculation we're not sure of the date it's rumor that's why I stuck it at the end but it's worth keeping an eye on as we get close to the end of January all right that's what we got for AI news let me know what you think cheers",

    "description": "My site: https://natebjones.com/\nMy links: https://linktr.ee/natebjones\nMy substack: https://natesnewsletter.substack.com/\nMayo AI: https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-accelerates-personalized-medicine-through-foundation-models-with-microsoft-research-and-cerebras-systems/\nHailuo Minimax paper: https://filecdn.minimax.chat/_Arxiv_MiniMax_01_Report.pdf\nReddit: https://www.businessinsider.com/reddit-answers-how-it-works-performs-early-access-2024-12\n\n\nTakeaways:\n 1. AI in Radiology: Mayo Clinic is using AI to streamline radiology workflows, including report generation, tube placement evaluation, and change detection in chest X-rays, moving beyond anecdotal successes to clinical integration.\n 2. Genomic Personalization: Mayo Clinic is collaborating with Azure to create a \u201cperfect human genome\u201d reference dataset, potentially advancing personalized medicine through genome variant analysis.\n 3. 4M Token Context Window: Hailuo\u2019s Minimax model offers a groundbreaking 4-million token context window with perfect recall, showcasing advancements in solving the long-context memory challenge.\n 4. ChatGPT Memory Upgrade: OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT beta is testing advanced memory capabilities, signaling progress in addressing AI\u2019s memory limitations for improved recall and contextual understanding.\n 5. Reddit Answers Launch: Reddit rolled out Reddit Answers, an AI-powered search tool providing conversational insights. By prioritizing quality over speed, Reddit differentiates itself from competitors like Google.\n 6. OpenAI Speculation: Rumored upcoming releases include the 03 model, Project Orion (possibly GPT-5), and a new class of AI agents, \u201coperators,\u201d potentially revolutionizing AI task automation.\n\nQuotes:\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing Mayo Clinic put AI into real-world, high-stakes workflows\u2014it\u2019s a moment for AI in medicine.\u201d\n\u201c4 million tokens with perfect recall in Hailuo\u2019s Minimax model? Long-context memory is becoming real.\u201d\n\u201cReddit took its time to get AI search right, and it might just outshine Google\u2019s rushed approach.\u201d\n\nSummary:\nAI applications continue to expand, with Mayo Clinic leveraging AI for radiology workflows and genomic personalization. Hailuo introduced a 4M token model with perfect recall, pushing the boundaries of context management. OpenAI is testing advanced memory for ChatGPT, suggesting 2025 will focus on solving AI\u2019s memory problem. Reddit launched Reddit Answers, prioritizing quality in conversational search. Speculation surrounds OpenAI\u2019s January releases, including the 03 model, Project Orion, and \u201coperators,\u201d a potential leap in agent-based workflows. The field is rapidly evolving with high-impact launches and innovations across health, search, and memory-driven AI models.\n\nKeywords:\nMayo Clinic, radiology AI, genomic personalization, Azure, Hailuo, Minimax model, 4M token context, OpenAI, ChatGPT memory, Reddit Answers, AI search, Project Orion, GPT-5, operators, agent-based workflows, AI applications, AI in medicine, 2025 AI trends, long-context memory, workflow automation, AI innovation.",
