  "raw_transcript": "The reality is that we we have to recognize that engineering is what enables us to take this wild world where LLMs can speak language and where they're probabilistic and where they can bring intelligence to bear. Engineers help wrestle that into an operational stable production system. They help to bring observability to those systems. They help to debug those systems. They help to figure out the energy and compute footprint that's appropriate for those systems. And engineers ultimately are cultural architects. They help us to design workflows that preserve human judgment. They help us to build interfaces that make AI reasoning inspectable. They help us to prevent automation bias and skill atrophy if they're designing systems well. Ultimately, they help us maintain dignity because they can build systems that have to admit ignorance. Engineers have more responsibility now, not",

    "description": "My site: https://natebjones.com\nMy substack: https://natesnewsletter.substack.com/\nThe story: https://open.substack.com/pub/natesnewsletter/p/software-engineering-isnt-dead-its?r=1z4sm5&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&showWelcomeOnShare=true\n\nTakeaways:\n 1. Engineering Over Code Generation: AI can write code, but engineered systems require invariants, interfaces, safety cases, and reliability under load.\n 2. AI as Force Multiplier: AI democratizes coding, yet chiefly amplifies trained engineers; the real divide shifts from \u201cwho can code\u201d to \u201cwho can engineer.\u201d\n 3. Human Responsibilities Don\u2019t Go Away: Engineers translate intent to specs, convert probabilistic behavior into contracts, reason about emergent effects at scale, and manage latency\u2013quality\u2013cost trade-offs.\n 4. New Disciplines, Same Ethos: Semantic, boundary, memory/knowledge, and safety & assurance engineering emerge to tame injection, drift, context/versioning, and auditability.\n 5. Enduring Human Skills Matter: System intuition, empathy for messy human use, judgment under uncertainty, and orchestration of complex toolchains determine outcomes.\n 6. Demos Aren\u2019t Production: Production demands observability, telemetry, semantic forensics, and design for hostile inputs; \u201cworks once\u201d doesn\u2019t count.\n 7. Three Laws for AI-Era Engineering: 1) No invariants \u2192 not engineered; 2) Not measurable in prod \u2192 not built; 3) Can\u2019t explain failure \u2192 you don\u2019t own it.\n\nQuotes:\n\u201cAI writes code; engineers write invariants, interfaces, and guarantees.\u201d\n\u201cThe divide isn\u2019t who can code\u2014it\u2019s who can engineer.\u201d\n\u201cIf you can\u2019t measure it in production and explain failures, you don\u2019t own the system.\u201d\n\nSummary:\nThis is my love letter to engineering in the age of AI. AI can generate working code, but engineered systems demand invariants, guarantees, and accountability. I argue the divide is shifting from who can code to who can engineer: translate intent into specs, write contracts for probabilistic components, think at scale, and practice economic engineering. New disciplines emerge\u2014semantic, boundary, memory/knowledge, and safety assurance\u2014while timeless skills endure: system intuition, empathy, judgment under uncertainty, and orchestration of complexity. I close with three laws: define invariants, measure in production, and explain failures. Engineers aren\u2019t being replaced; they\u2019re being asked to carry greater responsibility.\n\nKeywords:\nengineering, AI, vibe coding, invariants, probabilistic systems, intent to specification, observability, telemetry, semantic forensics, injection attacks, semantic engineering, boundary engineering, memory engineering, knowledge engineering, safety assurance, model drift, emergent behavior, orchestration, economic engineering, production readiness, accountability, human-in-the-loop, reliability, scale effects, guarantees",
