  "raw_transcript": "I'm here to tell you all about Chad gp5 and know that is not just clickbait we actually have real news on it so Sam mman published a blog post uh a couple of hours ago that lays out his personal Vision or roadmap for where they're going next and yes it includes talk of GPT 5 it includes what uh they call internally Orion which got leaked all over the internet in the fall and then never materialized let me tell you about it net net what Sam wanted to emphasize in his blog post is that he has become very concerned about the number of models in the drop down and how complex they are to use just to give you a couple examples if I hit my drop-down now in the chat GPT app I can see one two three four five six models that are visible and more models hiding in a carrot plus a temporary chat icon that's too many like if you can see 4 40 with scheduled task 01 03 mini 03 mini High 01 PR mode and by the way none of those is operator none of those is deep research I have to go to chat gp.com to use deep research I can't even use the app right now even though the results appear in the app it's a very very confused experience and so Sam is basically saying this is not what we want the magic of intelligence to be it should not be this ridiculously complex picker where you don't even know what the what the heck you're picking and so what he said was they are going to release Orion or GP 2 4.5 it is supposed to be very good but it is not a reasoning model which means it doesn't use inference time compute and I want to be really precise about this because people are kind of equating the cheaper more widely available reasoning models with deep inference reasoning models and I think that we need to get better at naming you have models like GPT 4 o right now or Claude that just come back with something very quick you also have models that claim to be thinking models but that do not think for minutes at a time they think for under 60 seconds generally I would argue that uh the flash thinking model from Google is a good example I think deep seek is a good example uh there's a number of other examples as well and then you have models in a third class that think for more than 60 seconds at a time and do deep inference 01 Pro is a great example there there aren't a lot of other examples and it's unfortunate that 01 Pro is not more widely available because I think if people used it they would understand there is that third class and the results are definitely different and meaningfully better if you give the model that much time I think the closest that people are starting to see is when they're starting to see deep research and starting to see the results of deep research published on the internet deep research is another thinking model it takes a very long time to infer and come up with something but it's very compelling report and that's leaking all over the internet now people are seeing the results and are rightly amazed so we have at least three classes of model people are generally conflating them into two I think that's not helpful and what Sam is saying is 4.5 or oion is really in that first class it's a fast response model it's just very very good now that being said he has made it clear that that is the last Model that they are going to release as a separate model it will be named 4.5 probably and it will appear in the UI and that will be that since he gave a hint previously it would be during the winter I think that gives him about one more month to release it and then he says he's moving on what is he moving to chat gp5 so he's keeping the GPT branding but every other capability they have built is getting wrapped under that name label and brand which is a good branding decision Chad gp5 will have deep research Chad gp5 will have operator mode Chad gp5 can think for minutes at a time or think for a second it will decide and it will decide based on the task that you give it as someone uh on Twitter said very snarkily chat GPT is the friends we made along the way basically it's all these models along the way and we bring them together and we wrapped them into one clean consumer bow so the consumer can use them now that all depends on a lot of really smart interpretation of user intent so we will have to see how well they do with that history suggests they're going to do pretty well and in terms of timing he didn't give a time but I'm strongly expecting GPT five to come out uh probably before the fall if I had to guess given their Pace they've been doing major releases every two or three months so I would expect sometime in the summer is my current guess and that is a guess I do not have private unknowable information it's just a guess so there you go that's what we know about the road map I am glad they're making the effort but I do have a fairly big question around 03 because we were promised 03 I we were promised 03 Pro I don't know where that is now I don't know where it is so we will just have to see um it may get wrapped in as GPT 5 and we just have to tolerate that I thought we were on a slightly faster time frame with it but maybe what Sam felt is that at the end of the day it's too complicated for people to add yet another number in model and so he decided to change it one more tidbit for you this is not about Sam mman it's not about open AI uh I just learned this the owners of ai.com which currently redirects to deep seek it's not deep seek I thought it was deep seek it's in pardonable that I think it's deep seek because it goes to deep seek so I thought deep seek bought it that's normally how domains work but no it's apparently a for profit separate entity run by run out of Malaysia um and someone bought that domain back in 1993 I wish i' bought that domain back in 1993 and they now make a mint renting the domain to whoever pays them and it appears that deep seek is currently using some their five and a half million or whatever they use to train the model to uh buy access or redirects from ai.com to deep seek so it's just a tidbit I have nothing more to follow up on other than the internet is weird and you can make money in lots of ways and someone has figured out out of Malaysia how to rent ai.com for what is presumably a pretty penny I am sure it is not cheap to do that so there you go that's your tidbit lots more on GPT 5 hope you enjoyed it",

    "title": "ChatGPT 5 and Project Orion: Official Updates from OpenAI",
    "description": "My site: https://natebjones.com/\nMy links: https://linktr.ee/natebjones\nMy substack: https://natesnewsletter.substack.com/\nRoadmap: https://x.com/sama/status/1889755723078443244\nMy writeup: https://natesnewsletter.substack.com/p/chatgpt-5-one-model-to-rule-them?r=1z4sm5\n\nTakeaways\n 1. GPT-4.5 (Orion) is Coming Soon\nOpenAI is set to release GPT-4.5 (internally called Orion), a high-speed model optimized for quick responses rather than deep inference. It is expected to launch by winter.\n 2. Simplifying the Model Selection Experience\nSam Altman is concerned about the complexity of the current model selection process. With multiple GPT-4.0 and experimental options in the dropdown, OpenAI plans to streamline the experience under one unified model: ChatGPT-5.\n 3. Three Distinct AI Model Types\nThere are three classes of models: (1) fast-response models like GPT-4, (2) short-duration reasoning models like Google\u2019s Flash Thinking, and (3) deep-inference models like 01 Pro, which think for minutes before responding. GPT-5 will unify these capabilities.\n 4. ChatGPT-5 Will Integrate All Features\nFuture releases will consolidate different AI capabilities into a single model. ChatGPT-5 will include deep research, operator mode, and various reasoning styles, allowing it to dynamically adjust based on user needs.\n 5. Timing of GPT-5 Release\nWhile no official date was given, OpenAI has been operating on a two-to-three-month major release cycle, making a summer 2025 release for GPT-5 a strong possibility.\n 6. Uncertainty Around GPT-3.5 Updates\nDespite prior mentions of a 03 Pro model, its future is unclear. It may be folded into GPT-5 instead of being released separately.\n 7. AI.com Redirects to DeepSeek, But Isn\u2019t Owned by Them\nAI.com currently redirects to DeepSeek, but the domain is actually owned by an independent for-profit entity based in Malaysia, which rents it to the highest bidder.\n\nQuotes\n \u2022 \u201cChatGPT-5 will have deep research. ChatGPT-5 will have operator mode. ChatGPT-5 can think for minutes at a time or think for a second. It will decide.\u201d\n \u2022 \u201cThe current model selection is not what we want the magic of intelligence to be. It should not be this ridiculously complex picker where you don\u2019t even know what the heck you\u2019re picking.\u201d\n \u2022 \u201cSomeone has figured out, out of Malaysia, how to rent AI.com for what is presumably a pretty penny. I am sure it is not cheap to do that.\u201d\n\nSummary\n\nSam Altman has laid out OpenAI\u2019s future roadmap, revealing that GPT-4.5 (Orion) will launch soon as a fast-response model. However, this will be the last separately named model, as OpenAI aims to simplify the ChatGPT experience. Instead of multiple dropdown options, ChatGPT-5 will unify all features, intelligently deciding when to use deep inference or quick reasoning. This approach streamlines the user experience while maintaining power and flexibility. Although no release date was given, a summer 2025 launch for GPT-5 is likely. Meanwhile, AI.com, which redirects to DeepSeek, is owned by a third-party entity renting it out for a significant price.\n\nKeywords\n\nChatGPT-5, GPT-4.5, Orion, Sam Altman, OpenAI, AI model selection, deep inference, reasoning models, AI roadmap, AI.com, DeepSeek, ChatGPT experience simplification, AI model consolidation, fast-response AI, operator mode, deep research mode",
