  "raw_transcript": "There is a paradox with containment. When we put export restrictions on another country, we intend to slow progress. But instead, because necessity is the mother of invention, we trigger efficiency breakthroughs. Deepseek achieved GPT4 level performance with 90% less compute. Innovation thrives under pressure consistently. We have 450,000 plus open models on hugging face, open AI models. Anybody can grab them. Researchers from both nations routinely publish together. That is, by the way, a fantastic thing. That is a great thing. Knowledge flows like water across national borders. It flows like the internet. And performance gaps over time are narrowing, not widening.",

    "description": "My story: https://open.substack.com/pub/natesnewsletter/p/july-4th-silicon-cookout-how-us-china?r=1z4sm5&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&showWelcomeOnShare=true\n\nMy site: https://natebjones.com/\nMy links: https://linktr.ee/natebjones\nMy substack: https://natesnewsletter.substack.com/\n\nTakeaways\n 1. Cold-War Frame Is Obsolete: Treating AI like nuclear weapons ignores internet-speed proliferation and invites miscalculation rather than restraint.\n 2. Containment Backfires: Export controls spur efficiency breakthroughs such as DeepSeek\u2019s GPT-4 performance with 90 % less compute, narrowing the U.S.\u2013China gap.\n 3. Shared Risks Cross Borders: Cyber cascades, bio-engineering misuse, and economic shocks will spread globally; no nation can fence them off.\n 4. Graduated Engagement: Compete on values and commerce, but cooperate on existential hazards through joint risk panels and parallel safety standards.\n 5. Practical Safety Tools: Establish technical hotlines for AI anomalies, shared research transparency zones, and third-party verification by neutral states.\n 6. Smart Rivalry Over Zero-Sum Race: Aligning on baseline protections lets both superpowers innovate while safeguarding humanity\u2019s long-term flourishing.\n\nQuotes\n\u201cWe don\u2019t live in a singleton world; intelligence now spreads at internet speed.\u201d\n\u201cYesterday\u2019s strategies fail when today\u2019s technology knows no borders.\u201d\n\u201cSmart rivalry means brothers can compete\u2014yet still have each other\u2019s backs.\u201d\n\nSummary\nIn this July 4th reflection, I explain why framing U.S.\u2013China AI development as a Cold War is dangerously outdated. Because models proliferate at internet speed, export controls backfire, driving breakthroughs like DeepSeek\u2019s GPT-4-level system built with 90 % less compute. Unchecked rivalry magnifies shared threats\u2014cyber cascading failures, bio-risks, economic shocks\u2014that ignore borders. I propose \u2018graduated engagement\u2019: compete where values diverge, but cooperate on existential risks through joint risk panels, AI hotlines, parallel safety standards, research transparency zones, and neutral third-party verification. Smart rivalry, not zero-sum containment, is the only path to a safer AI future for everyone.\n\nKeywords\nAI Cold War, AI competition, export controls, efficiency breakthrough, DeepSeek, GPT-4 parity, systemic risk, graduated engagement, AI safety standards, autonomous weapons, cyber cascades, bio-risk, economic shocks, AI hotlines, research transparency, third-party verification, U.S.\u2013China relations, superpowers, July 4th",
