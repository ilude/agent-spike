  "raw_transcript": "execs have to watch what they say on podcasts Before Christmas Mark benof CEO of Salesforce founder of Salesforce was chatting on the 20vc podcast and he said one of those things you say headed into the holidays it sounds really good if you're the CEO he said you know what we're getting this massive 30% increase in productivity from AI I'm feeling good we're not going to be hiring more engineers at Salesforce in 2025 I made not to that I was like okay we'll see what happens going to give him give him a chance well I checked the job post page today yeah there's over a hundred engineering roles and before someone comes for me and says oh they're all offshore no they're not oh you know they're all entry level no they're not oh they're all senior level no they're not it's a nice range like it looks like a fairly normal hiring page for engineering it doesn't look like a big change so you tell me right like if you're going to go out there without any provocation like no one is asking for this and you're going to say we're not hiring anymore well then maybe don't hire more I don't know the irony continues by the way so agent force is this big thing they are really pushing at Salesforce and one of the things Marcus said very publicly is that Sacha got it wrong on agents you can't Rebrand Copilot as an agent you have to have the data that Salesforce have has to make effective agentic decisions Etc Great so the problem is even though this agent is supposed to be very effective for sales Salesforce is hiring 2,000 sales people to sell the sales agents and lots of marketers to boot and so I I think it's a little bit disingenuous maybe it's the media right but it's a little disingenuous to emphasize that there is apparently a plan to not hire Engineers when in fact there is and when in fact the real larger hiring story is that Salesforce is hiring like crazy to handle surging AI demand so I just it's really ironic and I I I love irony I'm I I'm a mill this is what we do but but this is really delicious irony from an AI perspective hats off to Salesforce",

    "description": "About me: https://natebjones.com/\nMy links: https://linktr.ee/natebjones\nMy substack: https://natesnewsletter.substack.com/\nHiring sales guys: https://www.saastr.com/salesforce-actually-were-going-to-hire-2000-sales-execs-now-to-sell-ai/\nHiring engineers: https://www.salesforceben.com/salesforce-will-hire-no-more-software-engineers-in-2025-says-marc-benioff/\n\n\nTakeaways:\n 1. AI Productivity Claims Don\u2019t Match Reality: Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff claimed a 30% productivity boost from AI would eliminate the need for hiring engineers in 2025, but the careers page tells a different story.\n 2. Over 100 Engineering Roles Open: Despite the hiring freeze announcement, Salesforce is actively recruiting for engineering positions across various levels, from entry to senior.\n 3. Agentforce Needs Human Sales Help: Salesforce\u2019s AI sales tool, Agentforce, is supposed to revolutionize sales. Ironically, the company is hiring 2,000 salespeople to sell it.\n 4. Data as a Competitive Edge: Benioff emphasized Salesforce\u2019s unique data advantage for agentic decision-making, differentiating it from competitors like Microsoft\u2019s Copilot.\n 5. Marketing and Sales Surge: Alongside sales hires, Salesforce is also expanding its marketing team to support the push for AI-driven products.\n 6. Millennial-Approved Corporate Irony: The contrast between AI automation hype and the reality of significant human involvement highlights the delicious irony of AI implementation today.\n\nQuotes:\n \u2022 \u201cWe\u2019re not hiring engineers in 2025\u2026 except for the 100+ positions currently listed.\u201d\n \u2022 \u201cSalesforce is going for AI irony like a Millennial at Christmas.\u201d\n \u2022 \u201cAgentforce: the AI sales tool so effective, it needs 2,000 salespeople to sell it.\u201d\n\nSummary:\nBefore Christmas, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff claimed on the 20VC podcast that AI productivity gains meant no more engineers would be hired in 2025. However, Salesforce\u2019s careers page shows over 100 open engineering roles, disproving the claim. At the same time, Salesforce\u2019s AI sales tool, Agentforce, is being touted as revolutionary, but the company is hiring 2,000 salespeople to promote it, along with more marketers. This ironic juxtaposition between AI\u2019s promise and the reality of human labor highlights the gap between corporate AI hype and its practical implementation.\n\nKeywords:\nSalesforce, Marc Benioff, Agentforce, AI productivity, hiring freeze, engineering roles, salespeople, AI sales tools, AI irony, corporate strategy, 20VC podcast, data advantage, marketing expansion, tech industry trends, 2025 hiring strategy",
