  "raw_transcript": "Let's say you have to complete a workflow and you're trying to go through and get all the steps in your workflow done at work and maybe it's a a building a product requirements document. You have to go through each of those stages and build it out. You have to get approvals and then you have to go back and talk to engineers. That is something that is not really changing. Now you may have AI help you do it faster, but the workflow itself is pretty stable. I want to suggest to you that one of the things that is a key for an entrepreneur is to look at the world in those kinds of terms. Look at the parts that swap out when you add more intelligence and look at the parts that stay steady. In this case, the workflow stays kind of steady. You're still going to have senior PMs wrestling with requirements, wrestling with engineering on technical requirements, wrestling with business stakeholders, and trying to figure it out and trying to make the workflow go together. I know this because I've lived it. Well, in that world, the workflow is a painoint that additional intelligence doesn't actually solve.",
