And that becomes a workflow that I can get excited about because it's less sloppy and it fits into how teams already make decisions.",

    "description": "What\u2019s really happening inside Claude\u2019s new AI model for work?\nThe common story is that AI automates whole jobs \u2014 but the reality is more complicated: the best LLMs actually make it EASIER for humans to touch the work, get hands on, and make their best contributions.\n\nIn this video, I share the inside scoop on how this Claude release performs in real work\u2014decks, spreadsheets, docs, and code\u2014after head-to-head tests against GPT-5 and Opus 4.1, with a focus on decision-ready outputs and less prompt sensitivity:\n\n\u2022 Why clarity beats AI slop for decision-ready outputs.\n\u2022 How Claude self-checks slides, formulas, and dev servers.\n\u2022 What changed versus GPT-5 and Opus 4.1 in practice.\n\u2022 Where it speeds decks, spreadsheets, docs, and Claude code.\n\nFor teams, the upside is faster, clearer deliverables and shorter iteration loops; the risk is forgetting that judgment and domain expertise still do the final mile.\n\nSubscribe for daily AI strategy and news.\nFor deeper playbooks and analysis: https://natesnewsletter.substack.com/",
