  "raw_transcript": "one of the big questions in AI has been to what extent physical form factors are going to be tackled by the model makers which is a fancy way of saying will open AI do robotics will Google do robotics will meta do robotics we do have some of the answer we've seen what I would call breadcrumbs along the way in 2024 to suggest that open AI is strongly considering robotics they have hired some of the best physical device designers in the world including Johnny IV who used to work on design at Apple they are supposedly exploring making a wearable with Johnny we will see no prototype has yet leaked and just a couple of days ago news broke that they are seriously thinking about building robots again and I say again because they actually shut down their robot division in 2021 this was really before chat GPT caught on you remember when 3.5 came out this is not something that you would allow to drive a robot it wasn't making those kinds of decisions and now chat GPT is actually inside other company's robots for example figure which is shipping robots to factories now uses chat GPT in the brains of the robot it's natural if you're a CEO in Sam alman's position to think to yourself would it make sense for my company to get into robotics should I reawaken the robotics division well that's an interesting interesting question I think one of the bigger pieces they need to tackle is whether they as a company strategically are willing to play from behind I've been in a company that plays from behind Amazon was a rare second place player in video when I was there in Prime video Netflix dominated it was a very strange feeling to be in an otherwise dominant company and to be playing in a second place division that was working on catching up that is what would be happening in robotics at open AI unlike the rest of the company where open AI enjoys an advantage and is widely considered one of the leaders in the AI space it's a very different thing and it's very very difficult and takes a long time to catch up in those situations so I don't know if they're actually going to invest in robotics I am much more confident that they will invest in some kind of physical device it makes too much sense for them not to be in the physical world since so much of the customers interaction with AI is going to be in the physical space you might as well own the device and so I feel good about predicting that they will get into physical devices robots may be one way they do that but they may find it easier just to work with Johnny IV and get into wearables or something like that we will see either way I think my base case bet is we see some kind of a prototype before the end of next year before the end of 2025 you tell me what you think",

    "description": "About me: https://natebjones.com/\nMy links: https://linktr.ee/natebjones\nThe story: https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openai-has-discussed-making-a-humanoid-robot\n\nTakeaways:\n 1. OpenAI\u2019s Robotics Reawakening: OpenAI is considering reentering robotics after shutting down its robotics division in 2021, signaling a renewed interest in physical AI integration.\n 2. Johnny Ive Collaboration: OpenAI has partnered with Johnny Ive, Apple\u2019s former design legend, to potentially create physical devices, possibly wearables, that integrate AI.\n 3. ChatGPT in Robots: Companies like Figure are already integrating ChatGPT into robots, setting a precedent for OpenAI to expand into hardware-driven AI.\n 4. Strategic Challenges in Robotics: OpenAI faces the challenge of playing \u201cfrom behind\u201d in robotics, competing with established players, unlike its leadership in software AI.\n 5. Physical World Strategy: OpenAI sees physical devices as essential for AI interaction, with prototypes likely to emerge by the end of 2025.\n 6. Diverse Hardware Ambitions: Beyond robots, OpenAI might explore wearables or other physical tools to establish a foothold in real-world AI applications.\n\nQuotes:\n \u2022 \u201cChatGPT is actually inside other companies\u2019 robots. It\u2019s natural for Sam Altman to think, \u2018Should I reawaken the robotics division?\u2019\u201d\n \u2022 \u201cI feel good about predicting we\u2019ll see some kind of prototype from OpenAI before the end of 2025.\u201d\n \u2022 \u201cIt makes too much sense for OpenAI to be in the physical world since so much of the customer\u2019s interaction with AI is going to be there.\u201d\n\nSummary:\nOpenAI appears poised to reenter the robotics space, having shut down its robotics division in 2021. This follows news of its collaboration with Apple\u2019s Johnny Ive on potential physical devices, like wearables. Meanwhile, ChatGPT is already powering robots from companies like Figure, suggesting OpenAI could integrate AI into its own hardware. However, entering robotics would challenge OpenAI\u2019s dominance, requiring it to compete against established players. Still, OpenAI sees physical devices as critical for the future of AI interaction, making a prototype likely by the end of 2025. Whether it\u2019s robots or wearables, OpenAI\u2019s next steps will shape its physical AI strategy.\n\nKeywords:\nOpenAI, robotics, ChatGPT, AI devices, Johnny Ive, wearables, Figure, AI interaction, physical AI, AI hardware, 2025, prototype, AI applications, real-world AI, Sam Altman, AI strategy.",
