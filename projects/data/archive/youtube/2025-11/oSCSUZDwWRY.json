  "raw_transcript": "I haven't talked a ton about how legal is seeing tremendous changes with AI. But even though legal has a very high bar on accuracy, they cannot mess anything up. You can still use something like co-pilot to get an early read and reduce the time. I think the time taken was like 7 days to 7 hours and they got more consistent quality because they uploaded the contract and critically they asked the right prompts, identify obligations, identify deadlines, flag unusual terms compared to our standard which requires co-pilot to know your standard. Create a summary in plain English. It's all about the kinds of prompting that you bring. And you see how they're prompting in ways that give the AI room to succeed here. Healthcare is another example. You can use Copilot for patient discharge summaries. Doctors might spend 30 minutes writing discharges. Now, Copilot can just pull from patient records, create the discharge summary, including medications, and follow up and be done with it. It can result in a dramatic drop in the time spent doctors on doctors spend on paperwork and more time with patients.",
