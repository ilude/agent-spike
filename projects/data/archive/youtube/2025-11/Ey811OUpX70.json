  "raw_transcript": "we have three really big pieces of AI news today number one over the weekend a publication called the information broke the news that open AI was seeing diminishing returns on their work with AI and this was based apparently on Anonymous conversations with openai employees and specifically on the results of the 20% finished model training run for the 01 model the speculation is the 20% Mark is roughly where GPT 4.5 would be and what the leakers suggested is that this was only like marginally better not necessarily better at all at code Etc well a whole bunch of people and not just from open AI spent the weekend pushing back I mean you expect the leadership of open a to push back right the VP of product basically said this is not true without directly addressing it and what I thought was interesting is it wasn't just the open AI top brass it was also a bunch of other folks in the industry who really are only thinking about what is the correct solution for artificial general intelligence and do we hit a wall here that would prevent us getting there and so the information broke earlier in the weekend and by Sunday it was evident that most of the people who were well-versed in Ai and who are not at open AI were coming to open ai's defense and essentially saying you know what the information got this one wrong and the reason they got it wrong is that they're confusing large language models with the reasoning that 01 has simply because 01 presents as a reasoning model so when we're using one preview we type it into the same chatbot window but it does reasoning at the time of inference so when you type it in it can go and explore different chains of thought and reverse and change itself reverse and change itself reverse and change itself and use what are called reasoning tokens to eventually get to the correct answer if you ever want to see how that works I'll give you a really simple prompt for that just ask it to do a fairly complicated discount flow analysis in finance or ask it to do a uh compound annual growth return in finance it knows those formulas but if you don't give it too much information it has to infer a lot and so it will and you will actually see it sometimes correct itself and you'll see it eventually lay out a really clear methodology for how it solves the problem if you give that same problem to 40 it will not work nearly as well in fact I did that last night and what I saw was clearly an actual rational response from 01 and clearly much more simple next token prediction from 40 and so I think what the open ai's vpa product said got it right at the end of the day the question of whether an llm is hitting a diminishing rate of return on training on data is different than whether or not you are getting more value out of reasoning and open AI has been telegraphing for months that they a lot of the value in scaling intelligence as scaling at the time of inference or scaling reasoning so we will see but it just looks like the information got very very excited about reporting something that they thought was scandalous and surprising and rushed it to print a little bit too much because it gave the impression that open AI was out of juice and the reality is open AI is just at the beginning of releasing something interesting and I actually think that is one of the things that makes this leak seem a little bit malicious 01 the full 01 model is rumored to be released this week now I've been doing this for a bit I've been seeing these rumors come out so that's not that surprising that they're rumoring it this week maybe it will happen this week maybe not but it's supposed to happen by the end of the year we're coming up into the teeth of the end of the year and it is very interesting that they would choose to play for clicks in this way right now all right I've said enough about that number two the US has ordered tsmc to Halt export of roughly speaking AI chips to China if you want to dig into the details it's uh chips below the 7 nanometer architecture specifically going for gpus used in AI applications and you might wonder I wondered how on Earth is the United States government able to restrict exports from Taiwan to China it doesn't make sense well it turns out that we have a special set of rules called the E the export administrative something I'm going to have to look this up a second it's the uh export administrative rules that are authorized by the export control Reform Act of 2018 I did my research on this um and what basically what it does is it allows you to if you are the US government regulate the export from other countries of things that are produced using US tech and in this case the chips have us design input a lot of the sort of routine in tsmc is you get the chip designed from the US and then you manufacture it in Taiwan on that basis of the intellectual property and the chips the Chamber of com the US Department of Commerce is a able to regulate export of the chips from Taiwan and that's what they're doing and the reason they did it and this is not as widely reported is that a chip that had gone to a Chinese customer which was legal at the time ended up in a huahe device which is not legal because the US has put huah on a export restrictions list and so basically seeing that like there's some unlicensed transfer of these chips inside China the Department of Commerce basically said no just stop exporting to China until we figure this out and so that's what as of today tsmc is doing now separately people are wondering how tariffs if they come will affect AI chip production and one of the plays for a lot of other materials is that people ask themselves can we do final assembly in the US in this case Taiwan has sent a very clear signal that you won't be able to because it is said explicitly that they have regulations on the books in Taiwan that say that advanced chip manufacturing capabilities in this case the current top generation is 2 nanometer that they will not be able to make them elsewhere because they have regulations saying that capability stays on Taiwanese soil so we will see we have some competing regulations and in the meantime I'm hoping that these weird photos that open AI employees continue to post about the Orion Nebula end up meaning something right like surely they can't just post pictures of the stars and not release models we will see",

    "description": "About me: https://www.natebjones.com/\nMy links: https://linktr.ee/natebjones\n\nTSMC export ban: https://www.reuters.com/technology/us-ordered-tsmc-halt-shipments-china-chips-used-ai-applications-source-says-2024-11-10/\no1 reasoning: https://x.com/_jasonwei/status/1855417833775309171\nInformation OpenAI article: https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openai-shifts-strategy-as-rate-of-gpt-ai-improvements-slows\ntariffs and 2nm: https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/tsmc-cannot-produce-2nm-chips-overseas-until-domestic-output-becomes-more-advanced-confirms-taiwanese-govt-official\n\n1. **Takeaways**: \n\n   1. Diminishing Returns in AI: OpenAI\u2019s O1 model training appears to yield limited gains, with early indications showing only minor improvements over GPT-4, sparking debate about the current limits of model enhancement.\n   2. Industry Pushback: Despite the news leak, AI leaders outside OpenAI defend the ongoing model improvements, emphasizing that \"reasoning models\" like O1 may require a different approach than previous large language models.\n   3. Advanced Reasoning Capabilities: O1 exhibits a unique ability to reason through complex problems by adjusting responses in real-time, making it particularly effective in tasks like financial analyses.\n   4. U.S. Export Control on AI Chips: The U.S. has directed TSMC to halt exports of advanced AI chips to China, citing intellectual property laws that restrict U.S.-designed tech from reaching banned recipients.\n   5. Taiwan\u2019s Regulations: Taiwan\u2019s government mandates that top-level chip production, especially cutting-edge two-nanometer chips, stays within the country, complicating international production and export dynamics.\n   6. Speculation on O1 Release: Rumors suggest the O1 model may release soon, potentially by year\u2019s end, adding intrigue to OpenAI\u2019s future capabilities in reasoning and AGI advancements.\n\n2. **Quotes**: \n\n   \"Are we reaching a wall in AI development, or are we just beginning to unlock true reasoning?\"\n   \"O1\u2019s ability to change its approach in real-time makes it a leap forward in AI\u2019s reasoning power.\"\n   \"The intersection of AI innovation and geopolitics is shifting as the U.S. restricts Taiwan-made chips from reaching China.\"\n\n3. **Summary**: \n\n   OpenAI\u2019s O1 model, currently in training, shows limited improvement over GPT-4, raising questions about the diminishing returns of large language model training. However, some industry experts believe the model\u2019s unique reasoning ability could signal a different path toward advanced AI. Meanwhile, the U.S. has halted TSMC\u2019s export of specific chips to China due to intellectual property restrictions, underscoring the global geopolitical implications of AI technology. Taiwan\u2019s own regulations further restrict advanced chip production to local soil, impacting potential responses. These developments highlight the complex interplay of innovation, policy, and progress in AI.\n\n4. **Keywords**: \n\n   OpenAI, O1 model, diminishing returns, large language models, reasoning models, TSMC, AI chips, export control, Taiwan, China, intellectual property, advanced reasoning, AGI, model training, U.S. Department of Commerce, geopolitics, chip production, AI innovation",
