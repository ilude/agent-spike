  "raw_transcript": "You know, yesterday the New York Times published what's essentially a hit piece on the idea that we can make artificial general intelligence. It's called Silicon Valley's Elusive Fantasy. And I almost never do direct responses to media pieces cuz I generally don't think it's productive in this case because of the prominence of that newspaper and particularly because of the number of people who have reached out to me and essentially challenged the idea that AI can innovate. This needs to be addressed. We need to put to bed the idea that the advances of the last 24 months haven't mattered. And I'm going to do it not by taking apart the article in particular, but by talking about factual advances that recent AI has enabled us to make across a really, really wide range of fields. You may know some of these. I doubt you know them all. And so sit back. We're going to go through quite a few here. And I'll do them pretty quickly so we can get out in good time. Number one, Google has trained a reinforcement learning agent called AlphaDev uh that has discovered sorting algorithms that humans have never written before. It makes up to 70 it makes new routines that are up to 70% faster on short sequences and can ship mainstream C++ tool chains. Number two, MIT researchers fed 6,000 chemical structures into a deep learning AI model and it surfaced an unexpected molecule that they've named Allison. Lab tests have shown that it kills multiple panes pathogens where existing drugs fail and it's opening an entirely new antibiotic class discovered solely by AIEL exploration. Number three, alpha fold models have predicted 200 million complete protein structures, many of which lacked any experimental data. The open database is already accelerating malaria vaccine design. It's accelerating antibbody engineering and is believed to have saved hundreds of millions of research years or hundreds of years of work in a wet lab environment. DeepMind's Gnome system has used graph neural networks to generate 2.2 million crystalline compounds, of which 380,000 are predicted to be stable. Lawrence Berkeley's lab was able to quickly synthesize 41 of those brand new compounds autonomously and validated that AI can invent and that a lab can build materials that humans did not imagine. IBM research is coupling large-scale generative models with physics simulators to create highfidelity battery digital twins. You're like, why do we need this? It enables us to slash iteration cycles for designing cathodes and electrolytes. And it lets scientists explore the chemistry of batteries in ways that were inaccessible with conventional lab only workflows. Engineers at NASA Gddard have used evolutionary design software to grow alien looking titanium mounts that are lighter and stronger and delivered in weeks, not months. And the shapes are so novel that the engineers themselves say they wouldn't have conceived them without AIdriven exploration. Each of these cases on the science front goes beyond pattern matching. The systems are searching an enormous sparsely labeled solution space and they're producing artifacts that outperform the best human benchmarks. These are not just statistical parrots, which is what the New York Times uses as a frame. They're engines of creativity in ways that humans are not. They they use combinatorial creativity by leveraging compute across very large data sets that surpasses human intuition. This is falsifying a poorly sourced blanket claim like AI cannot innovate. I am the last one to say that the technology doesn't have limitations. I talk about that on here. AI has bias issues. AI has brittleleness issues. AI is really hungry for data. These are real constraints. But the capacity for innovation is a proven fact at this point. And it is really frustrating to see media narratives continue to confuse people. I'm not just going to stick with science. You might think, has AI really delivered productivity gains, something the New York Times claims it hasn't. UPS's route optimization engine uses machine learning to plan 55,000 driver stops each morning. Amazon has something similar internally. And UPS is reporting that their company now saves a 100 million miles and 10 million gallons of fuel every single year because of AI. The claim that systems can't understand images, audio, and text together is exactly what chat GPT40 does and has been doing for a while. The model can identify a handwritten math problem on the board from a camera phone, talk the user through it, and respond naturally. I myself have used it for code where you point it at some code and talk it through. It's exactly what the Times claims it can't do. Current models don't match humans on serious reasoning tasks. That's another claim I hear. Look, that's just not going to hold up. Like you you can pick whatever bar you want. Uh literally the uniform bar exam is one uh chat GPT4, an older model, scored 90% on that bar exam. 03 does even better. I will be honest with you, some days 03 feels like it's smarter than I am. AI hasn't produced concrete medical breakthroughs. There's another claim. We've talked about that one. We've talked about the antibiotics. Another one that I think is a breakthrough in bedside manner. A lot of studies show that diagnosis uh is more accurate and bedside manner is better with AI. Sometimes with AI alone, not with doctors because they do test doctor only, AI only and doctor and AI. Often times the AI which may only be chat GPT4 because these models need to be peer-reviewed still do better than the doctor. AI hasn't learned new physical tasks. That's just not true. We're getting real breakthroughs in robotics. If you haven't seen the videos of the robots that pack uh a refrigerator or the robots that unscrew bottle caps or the robots that pack lunch boxes they were never explicitly trained for, go look them up. It's real. Uh in fact, a number of different robotics firms do this. Frankly, China's probably ahead of us on this one. The claim that AI hasn't improved accessibility for disabled users. I know friends of mine who are disabled who use AI as a hack every single day. Uh and a as an example of something that's coming quickly. Uh did you know that like Apple is actually launching a magnifier for Mac where you can strap your phone to a laptop and it will literally magnify any part of the room. So a low vision user can pipe any part of the room they're looking at into a Mac and actually increase the size and use it the way they want to. Frankly, you can do that now with chat GPT, too. It's not just an AI, it's not just a Mac feature. It's an AI thing. You can walk around with your phone in chat GPT and like use the camera to look and have a conversation. You can do that with live translation translation. Statistical parrots, which is something that the New York Times claims, do not have live translation capabilities, but people are using Chad GPT to live translate between languages now. And so it's not it's not that questioning or skepticism is out of place. It is right to ask really hard questions of AI. But I would prefer that we ask better quality questions. Questions that are reasonable given what we know about AI progress? For example, why is it so much easier for AI to make progress in scientific fields than it is in other fields? By the way, I think the answer is likely because correctness is something that is provable and LLMs are fundamentally a branch of machine learning and machine learning does better with correctly provable solutions since you can drive reinforcement learning off of it. There are real answers for those real questions. There are other questions that are harder to answer like how do we handle ongoing data availability as models get hungrier and hungry hungrier for data? How do we understand how work and startup dynamics change as these models come into the workplace? These are real questions. I talk about them a lot. I think they're worth thrushing out in detail and they're much worth they're much more worth column inches than repeating tired claims that are factually incorrect at this point. I would really really love to have media conversations that do not drive misinformation into my inbox. I am tired of people who are rightfully confused reaching out to me saying, \"Hey, Nate, can you explain? I I thought I thought that you said AI was innovative and look at this media publication saying it's not.\" That is confusing. It totally makes sense. You'd be confused. It's not on them. It's on the media to be more responsible about this. We need to take the idea that AI is innovative seriously.",

    "description": "My site: https://natebjones.com/\nMy links: https://linktr.ee/natebjones\nMy substack: https://natesnewsletter.substack.com/\n\nThe story: https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/16/technology/what-is-agi.html#:~:text=According%20to%20various%20benchmark%20tests,They%20are%20very%20impressive%20gadgets.%E2%80%9D\n\nTakeaways\n 1. Scientific Proof of Innovation: From AlphaDev\u2019s brand-new sorting algorithms to NASA\u2019s generative titanium mounts, modern AI systems are delivering solutions humans never conceived.\n 2. Breakthrough Drug Discovery: MIT\u2019s model-driven identification of halicin shows AI can surface entirely new antibiotic classes that defeat pan-resistant bacteria.\n 3. Materials and Protein Revolutions: AlphaFold\u2019s 200 M protein atlas and DeepMind\u2019s GNoME pipeline are reshaping biology and materials science by predicting structures at super-human scale and speed.\n 4. Tangible Productivity Gains: UPS\u2019s ORION engine saves 100 M miles and 10 M gallons of fuel yearly, while Microsoft Copilot gives knowledge workers multiple reclaimed hours each week.\n 5. Multimodal Capability Realized: GPT-4o interprets images, audio, and text in one seamless conversation\u2014disproving claims that models can\u2019t truly understand mixed modalities.\n 6. Accessibility in Action: Apple\u2019s forthcoming Magnifier lets low-vision users zoom any room by piping an iPhone camera into macOS, extending AI\u2019s benefit beyond the lab.\n 7. Call for Higher-Quality Debate: The real questions now revolve around governance, data pipelines, and workplace change\u2014not whether AI can innovate at all.\n\nQuotes\n\u201cWe need to put to bed the idea that the advances of the last 24 months haven\u2019t mattered.\u201d\n\u201cThe capacity for innovation is a proven fact at this point.\u201d\n\u201cArguing about whether AI can create at all is yesterday\u2019s fight\u2014the data has already decided it.\u201d\n\nSummary\nI recorded this response after the New York Times labeled AGI a Silicon Valley fantasy. Rather than dissect their article line by line, I walked listeners through six concrete breakthroughs that only modern AI delivers: AlphaDev\u2019s faster algorithms, halicin\u2019s discovery, AlphaFold\u2019s 200-million protein atlas, GNoME\u2019s synthesized crystals, IBM\u2019s battery digital twins, and NASA\u2019s generative hardware. I added tangible real-world wins like UPS\u2019s fuel savings, Microsoft Copilot\u2019s reclaimed hours, and Apple\u2019s new Magnifier. Bias, brittleness, and data hunger are real, yet innovation is settled fact. The debate must pivot to governance, data supply, and growing workforce adaptation\u2014not whether AI can create.\n\nKeywords\nAGI, AI innovation, AlphaDev, halicin, AlphaFold, GNoME, battery digital twins, NASA generative design, UPS ORION, Microsoft Copilot, Apple Magnifier, GPT-4o, multimodal AI, productivity gains, media skepticism",
