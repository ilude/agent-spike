  "raw_transcript": "all right we have two pieces of news today first the Sora announcement which has been long awaited I think it's 9 months now I thought it was seven or eight but I I'm wrong time is a flat circle it's been at least nine months since Sora was teased and open AI finally announced it and no you cannot have it and we'll get into why uh and then Willow which is arguably bigger news that Google dropped by surprise so Sora first Sora is a text to video system Sora was teased a long time ago I guess it was 9 months ago and it looked incredible then there was a leak over the weekend by some angry artists who were in a theater who were filming it secretly and it looked incredible in the leak so ironically the artist probably increased uptake on the new product and uptake was so high after 10: a.m. Pacific yesterday when they announced it that within an hour they were shutting down access they just did not have the compute to handle it and that suggests to me that they don't know when most people who were trying to sign up through the day going to get access they severely underestimated demand and I think that was a foreseeable problem like at the end of the day if you tease this for nine months and then an artist leaks it the weekend before which you know you can't control but you should expect a lot of demand because the leak looked incredible everyone wants to type in their move the idea and see it come to life and even though we're all only getting like 5sec videos on Plus plans and 20 second videos on Pro plans we we have this ability to take our imagination and put it on a screen and we we all want to try and I I sympathize with them they've built something so magical that everyone wants it like sympathy isn't the right word it's incredible they have a wonderful highquality problem I'm in awe maybe that's a better word like well done but I don't know when we're going to access it because this is heavy heavy compute to get a video out of a piece of text they have a bunch of other heavy compute applications they have more days of open AI they are doing new kinds of compute with 01 and 01 Pro so I'm not sure what's going to happen or when Sor is going to be widely available I know they're doing their best uh and we'll just have to see the team is building magic effectively and it turns out most people in the world want magic and we will have to see when the computers are available so that we can all play with our text video ideas moving on to Willow arguably the bigger news of the day Willow is a Quantum chip from Google Now I want you to have the context that Google does Quantum announcements every fall like clockwork they just do and the reason why this one is interesting is this chip has demonstrated the ability to scale cubit while reducing errors for 30 some years Quantum Computing has meant scaling Quantum cubits and getting more and more errors so the system becomes more unstable it's inherently unscalable Google thinks they have solved that scalability problem and The Willow chip is basically a demonstration piece to say look we can do this at a scale of 105 cubits a cubit by the way is instead of the classical bit with two states a cubit has three states it has zero and one and super position and having that additional bit state allows it to calculate in parallel so it can calculate eight states in parallel with like a single bit for example now you start to scale that up you start to get very very combinatorial very very fast and so Google rightly called out that part of why they're focused on Quantum is they see the potential long-term for Quantum to outscale AI and this is where the caveats come in there was a lot of hand ringing on the internet that like our passwords aren't safe and our Bitcoin seed phrases aren't safe and this and that this is not a commercially scalable chip this is not coming to iPhone this is not coming to laptops this is living in a research lab it may get to a few science labs that want to look at Quantum interactions but Google themselves admits they're a long way from something stable enough that they can go after a potential chip build right now the cubits themselves world record they're staying staying stable for five micros seconds I believe it it it's a tiny amount of time and if you are having trouble with stability and you're still trying to figure out how to scale yes like for people who are in the space of cryptography now is probably the time to start thinking about postquantum cryptography good thing to get ahead on that and there are people who are based on what I read on X they're like running to their computers and working on it but for ordinary people this is not going to be used to hack things right away there's just not enough of them they're not in that uh environment and even the test that was run the really famous one where it was like the the headline on the announcements they can do a calculation in five minutes that would take a supercomputer 10 septian years amazing but it was a deliberately designed test calculation it wasn't a piece of like algorithmic math we use in computers so it does a test calculation really fast that's great but that doesn't really help us with building software and systems so I don't want to take away from the achievement because getting to a spot where you can scale cuits and reduce errors over time is a massive achievement it's something that the quantum field has been working on for 30 years but that does not mean that it is commercially available and I saw some misunderstanding about that one last piece on the willow thing they casually threw out there I don't know another word for it it was an aside in the willow announcement and I'll link to that they said we suspect that the ability of this chip to solve problems where supercomputers would exceed the length of the livable universe and to do so in less than five minutes is in line with the theory that Quantum Computing occurs in multiple universes at once essentially what Google said is their chip is Computing in the Multiverse and uh by the way it's just you know by the way there's a Multiverse and we're Computing in it thanks Google I don't know what to do with that uh and uh this is a strange timeline to be living in and we will see how things progress from here every day seems to have a lot of news cheers",

    "description": "About me: https://natebjones.com/\nMy links: https://linktr.ee/natebjones\nWillow: https://blog.google/technology/research/google-willow-quantum-chip/\nSora: https://openai.com/sora/\n\nTakeaways:\n 1. Sora Launch Overload:\nOpenAI\u2019s long-awaited Sora text-to-video generator finally launched after nine months of teasing\u2014but demand skyrocketed after a weekend leak by artists. OpenAI had to pause signups within an hour due to compute limitations.\n 2. Video Creation Magic:\nSora enables users to turn text into video, generating 5-second clips on ChatGPT Plus and 20-second videos on Pro plans. The tech feels like \u201cbuilding magic,\u201d but scaling it is proving difficult.\n 3. Quantum Breakthrough with Willow:\nGoogle\u2019s Willow quantum chip shattered records by performing calculations in five minutes that would take a supercomputer 10 septillion years. Its real achievement? Scaling qubits while reducing errors, solving a 30-year quantum problem.\n 4. Not a Security Threat Yet:\nDespite online panic, Willow isn\u2019t ready to hack passwords or seed phrases. The chip is research-only, with 5-microsecond stability, far from commercial scalability. Post-quantum cryptography is still a long-term project.\n 5. Multiverse Speculation:\nGoogle casually suggested that Willow\u2019s quantum performance aligns with the multiverse theory. They implied that quantum computers might process information across multiple universes\u2014a mind-bending concept straight from science fiction.\n 6. Testing vs. Real Use:\nWillow\u2019s \u201cimpossible\u201d calculation was a test function, not a real-world algorithm. While groundbreaking, it\u2019s not software-ready and is meant for research labs, not consumer tech.\n\nQuotes:\n\n\u201cWe severely underestimated demand\u2026 most people won\u2019t access Sora anytime soon.\u201d\n\n\u201cGoogle said their chip is computing in the multiverse. Thanks, Google.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis quantum chip could outscale AI\u2014but it\u2019s still 30 years away from consumer tech.\u201d\n\nSummary:\nOpenAI\u2019s Sora text-to-video tool and Google\u2019s Willow quantum chip sparked tech-world buzz. Sora\u2019s demand overwhelmed OpenAI\u2019s servers after a leak boosted interest, forcing paused signups and slower video processing. Meanwhile, Google\u2019s Willow chip shattered quantum records, performing a task in five minutes that would take classical supercomputers 10 septillion years. Its breakthrough is error-correcting qubits, a huge leap for quantum research\u2014but not a consumer threat. Google even hinted at multiverse computing, adding a sci-fi twist to this milestone in tech history.\n\nKeywords:\nOpenAI, Sora, Willow, text-to-video, quantum computing, AI video generation, superposition, multiverse, API scaling, qubits, error correction, post-quantum cryptography, Google, Sam Altman, tech breakthroughs, research labs, quantum supremacy, computing power, AI scaling, cryptography security, API rollout.",
