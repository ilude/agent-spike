  "raw_transcript": "I want to talk today about one of the most subtle aspects but pervasive aspects of this AI revolution. AI compresses time. And we are living through it, right? We are living through this moment where we feel like we're always trying to catch up. DM after DM, email after email I get is, \"Nate, tell me how I can keep up with this. The news drops on Tuesday. The news drops on Wednesday. The news drops on Wednesday night. I can't keep up with everything. My prompting has to evolve. I have to pick up agents now. The list goes on. We feel like we're living through hypercompressed time is what I'm getting at. But the thing I want to talk about today is not our experience of time. It's the AI's experience of time because I think that's actually something we need to understand better. We experience time the way our species has always experienced time. Going forward, we have uh a surprisingly nonrational perception of time. The older you get, the more you understand the idea that the years that you've had as an adult feel shorter than the years that you had as a kid. So, our sense of time is wonky and tied to our species. I could go on and on. You can read up on it. AI doesn't have any of that. AI has logical clockdriven perception of time. And because of compute advances, AI ability to do things in time continues to accelerate. And so for AI, time is compressing as well. But it doesn't feel the same way. It's compressing the work you can do in a unit of time, not compressing the time it takes to do work. I'm going to say that one more time. For humans, it feels like time is getting short because there is so much work to do. For AI, it feels like work is getting compressed in because there's so much more compute and time is therefore expanding. And so even though I'm not here to talk about the interior perception of time for AI, I'll leave that to the philosophy students, it is clear that we have a very different understanding of what can be done in a given unit of time and it has realworld implications for us. As an example, we are not very far along on the idea of AI agents maintaining intent over time. It's very difficult to do this. The projection right now is that by 2026, maybe we will get to a point where an AI agent can spend a week on a task, which is a big deal. I got to tell you, people at my work spend months on tasks. We have to maintain strategic alignment over, you know, a year's time. We have to look multiple years into the future. We need to have a much larger sense of time. And when we do tasks, we need to retain important context for longer stretches of time, too. Now, we have all been there. The juror tickets do drop out of our brains. We do forget context. We are forgetful. And so, it's important not to judge the AI too hard if it also forgets. But the point is that humans generally speaking are better at maintaining intent over time than AI agents right now. And critically AI intelligence scaling is happening faster than intent over time scaling. So in intelligence is going like this, right? We all talk about it all the time. It's going vertical. Great. But the ability to scale intent over time is moving like this. Not moving very fast. And the only reason those slow advances are super meaningful is because compute advances and intelligence advances continue to enable the AI to do more with that time. And I want to come up with a little case study that I ran across from a Sequoia talk given by Jim Fan who works at NVIDIA. Now, Jim does robotics at NVIDIA and he proposes something he calls the physical touring test. So, if you're familiar with the touring test, the idea is you don't know if you're talking to a human or a robot. And I'm vastly simplifying. We basically have AIs that pass that now. Like, you can literally run a classical touring test and it will pass. And we've mostly not noticed. And that's really funny because all of the science fiction books thought that when a robot could pass the touring test, the whole world would change. I guess you could say we're living through an AI revolution and it's changing. I don't have my flying cars yet. I can't look out of the window of my space castle. That being said, the physical touring test is a much harder bar and we are not anywhere close to passing it. And I suspect that science fiction has sort of combined the conversational touring test with the physical touring test in most writing. And that's part of the disconnect right now between the future the writers of the 60s and 70s and 80s envisioned and what we actually have because the physical touring test requires a robot to be able to physically navigate a space like a human. And I give credit to Jim. don't really have words for it until he started to put it together. So he talks about the idea of like you're at a hackathon, you are cleaning up after the next morning, it's a complete mess. Your living room is a disaster. There's a pizza box here, there's a beer can there, you were on the Balmer curve, you have disorganized couch cushions, your video game was up cuz you were playing video games. Everything's a mess. And what he wants to challenge us to do is imagine a world where you go off to work. You come back at 5, everything is put back together. It's neat. The lamp is standing up. Now, you cannot tell if it was a robot that did it or a person that did it because you live in a world where robots can do all of that complicated physical work without issues. And if you've seen any footage of robots lately, you know that we are not close. We are not close to a world where a robot can go over to a beer can, gently pick it up, put it in recycling, navigate the whole house to do so, dodge the dog, avoid the tennis ball that's on the bottom of the stairs, uh, and then come back and set the pillows out and all of that. And do that for the entire room and clean it up entirely, autonomously, without direction. Now, intelligence is scaling really, really, really, really fast, but that kind of ability to be in physical space isn't. And that's sort of Jim's point. And this is where it comes back to time and AI. Jim suggests that part of what's interesting about the physical touring test is we can use virtual environments like the one Nvidia launched this year to compress a lot of training work for AI into a small amount of actual clock time. And so he talks in his conversation with Ed Sequoia about the fact that they were able to at Nvidia take 10 years worth of training in like ordinary time and com compress it down to 2 hours 10 years to two hours in a special simulated environment. Because in the simulated environment, you could parallelize, you could run stuff super fast, and the chips and the processors kept up, and the LLMs kept up, and there was no reason to go as slow as you would go in the real world with training. And so, they were able to take a 10-year training task and compress it to two hours. That is the kind of thing that gets my wheels turning when I think about how AI with compute scaling is going to enable new kinds of work in shorter time spans. And so if we go back to this idea that for us work is growing but time isn't changing and for the AI time may seem to be expanding because the compute and the capacity is expanding and they can do so much more as time passes inside a given unit of time that given a new Blackwell chip you can do more in an hour as an LLM than you could do before with an H100. Right? Just getting really physical. So when you think about it that way, if you have an agent working, I'm back to software now. We're we're leaving robotics behind. We'll do the robotics conversation another time. If you have an agent and you are asking that agent at work to do a task that normally takes you three months and the agent does very very high quality work but has a short ability to maintain intent over time. the intent over time may matter less because the agent has all the tools it needs, tremendous compute and throughput and works very very fast. And so it may be able to get done in four hours what would take you three months. Now I'm not here to say that means the end of work because I believe in Poleani's paradox which is that work is more than we can speak. I don't think work can be efficiently tokenized. Um, there's a lot more to work than our ability to describe a task. I can leave all of that aside. You can go find that on my Substack if you want to read about it. I've written about it pretty extensively. But I do think that with the right scopes, with with the right autonomy of decision-m around a particular problem scope, with the right tools, I can see a world where agents become incredibly intelligent interns. It's like you can manage an agent and you can give it a tough task. You have to give it the scope. You have to confirm the tooling is right. You have to validate the results. But it does an incredible amount of work in a short amount of time. We will see if that's true. Right now, probably the closest parallel to that is Devon. Devon's an engineering agent and really Devon acts like an engineering intern. If you are a senior engineer and you know what you're doing and you could code your way out of a corner, Devon's great if you want someone who will pick up your P3s, your SE3s and knock those out. Devon's great if you want someone to tackle a specific defined task and go after it. If you want someone to break out and go after um a few pieces of work in a particular area you want to code in today and get you some pull requests that you can review at the end of the day. If you want someone who will be your founding engineer, which some people have tried to use Devon for, it is a bad idea. Devon is not ready for that level of responsibility, Devon cannot decide or define system architectures. And people overusing it that way get frustrated. People also get frustrated to some extent because Devon isn't perfect. Devon will sometimes stray from the point. Devon will sometimes not be able to complete the work because Devon runs out of tokens. other issues come up that I suspect will come up with agents. In fact, I see Devon as an agent as sort of a first approximation preview of what it's going to look like to work with agents in the future. I think we're going to have running out of token issues. I think we're going to have did you give the agent a clear enough task issues. I think we're going to have did you give the agent too much responsibility issues. I think you're going to have did you scope what the agent was working on to the degree that fit its intelligence issues. And we're all going to have to be figuring that out, not just engineers, within the next year or so. But the point is this. If you think about that time piece again as we circle back, the more compute and the smarter these models get, the more they can get done with that time. And so it may be that even if that intent over time is only a week by the end of next year, it is enough time that real meaningful project work can get done if we define that scope correctly. And that's just kind of weird to me because as a human, I don't think about it that way. I don't think about it as I can get all of this work done next year because I'm going to get that much smarter. I mean, sure, I'm going to try and read. I'm going to try and learn from AI. We all try and get smarter, but I have no illusions. I can't upgrade the CPU up here. The machine can. And so I think one of the most interesting things we're not talking about is that intelligence gains are related to the way we use agent intent over time. And we should probably talk about that more.
