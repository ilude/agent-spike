  "raw_transcript": "Chad GPT is firing back at Deep seek and you know what you do when you're a product team and these are hard models to build and you can't just magically build another model or change everything all in a dime you respond with the thing you originally planned but you position it a little differently and they originally planned open AI did to release 03 Mini at the end of this month the heavy heavy heavy rumor is that it is today if they follow their usual practice it will be at 10:00 a.m. Pacific and about 4 half hours and if they do that you will see that 03 mini is going to be positioned versus deep seek they probably won't name deep seek on the call but it will be positioned as an amazing option even for free users they've changed that it was going to be available for plus users on a very limited basis but deep seek has upended the value chain with their free tier and so going to push that reasoning model down and even free tier users are going to get it this is a model that is supposed to be better than 01 so if we're right if what Sam mman has literally said is true then free tier users will have access to a better faster model with a 100 messages a day and they still won't have a one I don't know this is why they need to get their business model and their pricing and packaging figured out because this is a mess but the point is they're nervous enough to change the availability for 03 mini they know they're going to burn some cash as people use it but they need to get that market share back and win the Mind share of people who are running to deep seek that's kind of that strategy at the same time Sam has a very busy day on what's next he is in Washington DC uh I don't know how he's getting there because Reagan is closed which that's really bad um but he's in DC doing a briefing and the briefing is on rumor has it and this is this is there are rumors that I feel good about like 03 mini coming out in the next day or so and there are rumors that I'm like this is extremely sketchy but like there's probably some information in here somewhere this is in that latter category it's extremely sketchy but there's probably some information in here somewhere the rumor is that it is not 03 that he's in town to talk about that's too close to production it's something farther out but within the first half of the year uh 04 has been bandid around uh by some of the rumor vultures that might be it the point is that he feels like it has enough National Security implications which means Reed it's really really good that it's worth going to Washington to talk about one other tidbit on 03 again these guys cannot name their models for the life of them could you tell me the difference between 03 mini and 03 I would assume 03 mini is smaller as a model but that doesn't explain why it's faster automatically anyway 03 mini is fast 03 mini is smarter than 01 apparently um and 03 was tested as part of the new international AI safety report and the results are just bonkers the test results got submitted and it's O 01 has changed the game in the fall I know it seems a long way away and there are people who are like oh R1 is better than o1 which for the record I've played with them both I don't think it is um but whether even if you believe that 03 is just Bonkers good in the test results and it's it's not 03 mini they've got to pick a different name or something they won't but they they ought to when we get our hands on that it looks like it's a model that is going to be better than all but the top few experts in the world at a wide range of fields and even 01 Pro isn't testing as well it's it's just remarkable like I'm really excited for 03 and 03 Pro so we will see that is down the road as far as I know they're not releasing 03 and 03 Pro today I believe it is only 03 mini because 03 mini is a smaller model it's easier to complete safety training and yes it is a smaller model and that is that is one of those things that I wish that they would think about less to be honest with you because from a consumer perspective I don't care how much imaginary space your model takes up what I care about is the capabilities of the model what what can it actually do for me what can it do now that it couldn't do before and we have done a terrible job explaining to people how that works I actually wrote up a substack it's free on the um on the substack talking about how we don't understand the evals and the acronyms like ime and uh GP QA and like I did like what are these tests you have this little like no did this and this on the GP QA Diamond test and I'm like what what is that mean so I went and looked at the tests and I screenshotted them and I wrote about them and I kind of went through all of them I even looked at Humanity's last exam which just came out I think it's worth taking a look at because we need to understand as humans how we're measuring these things and understand how we're not measuring them like if I looked at it and I did there's a lot of math there's some real world coding there's some literature stuff on Humanity's last exam which they do the worst on but by and large we have no tests for the things we tend to use AI for every day and I think there is a gap there and I don't know how to fix it but I think that if we had a test that was more understandable to people it might help them figure out what AI can do and how AI performance differences are meaningful so something to think about I don't think we've solved that one but I think it's part of the problem it's part of why people don't understand what AI does and when a new model like deep deep sea comes along they're like what is this this is amazing or this is terrible but it's mostly like their priors their prior assumptions shaping that rather than just sort of rigorously thinking about what it can do y",

    "title": "Jan 30: ChatGPT o3-mini as a response to DeepSeek, plus Sam Altman in DC for secret AI briefing",
    "description": "My site: https://natebjones.com/\nMy links: https://linktr.ee/natebjones\nMy substack: https://natesnewsletter.substack.com/\n\nTakeaways:\n 1. OpenAI\u2019s Strategic Response to DeepSeek: OpenAI originally planned to release O3 Mini for Plus users, but DeepSeek\u2019s free-tier disruption forced them to adjust, making O3 Mini available for free users.\n 2. O3 Mini vs. O3 \u2013 Confusing Naming Conventions: O3 Mini is smaller and faster but still better than O1. However, OpenAI\u2019s unclear model naming continues to create confusion.\n 3. Sam Altman\u2019s Washington Visit \u2013 National Security Implications? Sam Altman is in D.C. today, not just for O3 Mini but for something more significant, possibly O4, hinting at an AI breakthrough with national security considerations.\n 4. The Business Model Challenge: OpenAI is burning cash to retain users and maintain its market share against DeepSeek, but unclear pricing and packaging decisions create confusion.\n 5. AI Evaluation Metrics Are Misaligned: Standard AI benchmarks (GPQA, IMA) don\u2019t reflect real-world use cases, leaving users without a clear understanding of how models actually perform in day-to-day tasks.\n 6. O3\u2019s Test Results Are Exceptional: O3 (not Mini) reportedly tested off the charts in AI safety evaluations, outperforming even O1 Pro in multiple areas.\n 7. AI Arms Race Intensifies: DeepSeek has disrupted OpenAI\u2019s strategy, forcing rapid adjustments. The competition between model providers is accelerating, and OpenAI is fighting to maintain its dominance.\n\nQuotes:\n\n\u201cWe need better AI benchmarks that actually reflect real-world use, not just academic tests like GPQA and IMA.\u201d\n\n\u201cOpenAI is burning cash to keep up with DeepSeek\u2014offering O3 Mini for free is a direct response to the competition.\u201d\n\n\u201cSam Altman\u2019s visit to D.C. isn\u2019t just about O3 Mini. If national security is involved, the next AI leap might be bigger than we think.\u201d\n\nSummary:\n\nOpenAI is responding to DeepSeek\u2019s free-tier disruption by making O3 Mini available to free users, a shift from its original Plus-only release plan. This model is faster and better than O1, though OpenAI\u2019s confusing naming conventions remain an issue. Meanwhile, Sam Altman is in Washington, D.C., reportedly discussing an AI advancement with national security implications, possibly O4. The AI arms race is heating up, with OpenAI making aggressive moves to retain market share. However, AI evaluation metrics remain inadequate, leaving users uncertain about what these models actually offer in real-world applications.\n\nKeywords:\nOpenAI, DeepSeek, O3 Mini, O3, AI model benchmarks, Sam Altman, AI safety, GPQA, IMA, AI competition, AI arms race, national security, free-tier AI, AI market share, AI disruption, AI evaluation, tech strategy, AI industry trends, model performance, AI development",
