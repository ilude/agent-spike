  "raw_transcript": "we are going to do an entire post on job loss and fears of job loss with artificial general intelligence buckle up your seat belts this is going to be very in-depth so first I'm going to start with a definition of artificial general intelligence that open AI is using I think it's useful roughly speaking if an AI system is widely deployed and is capable of doing almost all valuable work that humans do we should call it an AR arcial general intelligence by the way that includes yard work it includes car repair it includes the physical services that humans do that are economically valuable that AI is not close to touching today by that definition there is no way the chatbot that is on your laptop is close to artificial general intelligence so we will start there what happens in a world where artificial general intelligence truly becomes ubiquitous and we could even give ourselves an easier bar what happens if it can't do physical work but knowledge work it just becomes really good at doing most economically valuable work I have seen the studies I have seen doomers on YouTube I have seen panicked people in the Tik Tock comments on my Tik Tok Channel they all essentially say the same thing if we were to get AR artificial general intelligence we would all lose our jobs there would be no economically valuable work left to be done there would be widespread unemployment and the only way to prevent massive societal disruption would be Universal basic income or perhaps tokenomics where you are all sort of tiny investors in the AI that is doing the actual work of society I disagree I have disagreed for a long time but I don't think I've stated it as plainly as I am here and the reason I'm stating it really clearly is because I am tired of seeing study after study that treats the most crucial technology we are likely to see in our lifetime as if it were a commodity as if it were something that is a single variable to plug into a study AGI the variable you plug it into studies and then you can like work your math equation and you can see what happens that is not how actual artificial intelligence rule out is going to go we know it's going to be a ragged Edge we know that AI That's relevant for particular job families is going to look very different we know all of that already why don't our studies cover that and I'm not done yet that is just one initial critique of where the studies are falling down but there are two much more foundational pieces that the studies aren't taking account of of that we desperately need to fully understand they are jevans Paradox and morx Paradox and we are going to talk about both because they are crucial for understanding this moment jevans was an economist thinker in the 19th century he was writing about coal Coal at the time was very valuable and if coal became more abundant the thinking went that demand would stay flat like you have more coal there's only so much you can do with coal you can burn it but like how much use do you really have probably like it will become worth less jevans observed that that wasn't true as the abundance of the commodity increased demand for that commodity rose that is a foundational insight into how the way humans interact with technology works I want you to think about the internet we had I kid you not an original application for the internet that was watching a coffee maker to see if it had coffee in it you can look it up have we found other things to do with the internet since then we have we are really really good at finding new utility when supply of something useful grows another example right now currently is renewable energy we are producing so much renewable energy everybody's ejections keep breaking it looks like a vertical line it is absolutely insane how much renewable energy is being produced every year nobody can get the projections correct everybody keeps predicting a tapering off and it's just not happening because we keep finding more use for renewable energy it's jeevan's Paradox but I have not yet seen any studies that actually take account of jev's par Paradox when something like intelligence becomes cheaper and more abundant and you would think that would be a relevant thing to talk about because anecdotally I am seeing it happen all over the place this is not just for me by the way this is what I've observed working with dozens of people over the last few years hundreds of people speaking to many people when we use chatbots at work in our personal lives they are not one for one replacing people they are actually doing work that would not get done otherwise we are living out jeevan's Paradox I give my chatbot things to do that would just not get done otherwise like there nobody would do it it just wouldn't happen and yet we don't take account of that when we do our studies on the projections for the future of artificial general intelligence like it makes no sense like we need to fully load in the idea of jebin's paradox to really understand what the future looks like and it's one big reason why I'm more bullish on the future of jobs than a lot of the other people talking about AI right now Paradox number two morx paradox this one specifically about computer systems in AI a few decades ago moravec observed that it is very very easy to teach a machine to do things that humans find difficult and very very hard to teach a machine to do things that find Easy A few examples chess I find it hard to play chess even though I really enjoy it I still remember as a kid when a machine named deep blue from IBM beat Gary Kasper off I was so impressed it was relatively easy for the machine and we've since built machines that are even better at chess and now they've solved go or almost solved go I don't know the point is these tasks that humans find really hard are things that machines find easy and you can find numerous other examples like that on the other side humans find it relatively easy to walk most of us most humans find it relatively easy to catch a ball these are things that machines find really really hard and I'll go into knowledge work because you might say well this is all physical stuff right like what are we doing with knowledge work humans find negotiating politics and stakeholder Management in the internal people dynamics of a business relatively easy now some of us are really good at it some of us are okay at it some some of us we kind of know are not great at it but we know it exists and our Baseline level of fluency far exceeds what you could do with a machine and it's not that hard for us we don't really think about it a lot we are basically taking the social dynamics and cues we learn as small children in family and social situations and we're applying them in the organization outside the scope of this YouTube the point is we find it easy the machine finds it hard it's more of X Paradox so so think about it right now is chat GPT better than me at remembering every single fact about product management yes it is and I've been doing product management a long time it's unquestionably better than me at remembering all of the facts but would I hire chat GPT to replace me no because all of the other things that go into more of Paradox it can't do it's not close to doing it can't have a complex conversation about timing another conversation relative to a particular event that's happening in the calendar so we maximize Team Dynamics it can't have a conversation about how to best align the constraints we face in a sales environment with value propositions and deal rooms and figure out what that means for what we build next it can't even agentically proo protype without a lot of help right now will it get better at some of that it will but my point stands more ofx Paradox means that things that we find easy including in the work environment are hard for systems to learn and if they're hard to learn they're hard to learn well they're hard to learn in an AGI sense in the sense that it would cover most economically useful work because that requires a very high degree of completeness so yeah I think morx Paradox matters for AI I think Jin's Paradox matters for AI I have yet to see any projections of the future of the labor market take these really seriously and I'm not saying I have all of the answers I'm just saying if this is a transformative technology it deserves to be studied carefully and specifically and not just as one more variable thrown out in a YouTube video for clicks and and I'm tired of that and I'm tired of studies that project off of flawed and incomplete assumptions I think we can do better I think this technology is important enough that it deserves a better look and so if you are worried about Ai and jobs if you are in uh an economist role this is hopefully some fodder for thought if you are worried about Ai and jobs and you're just a white collar professional maybe this is encouraging but I also hope it's something that you reply to that you share that you save because from what I've seen this question that I am spending 10 minutes talking about is the question everyone has under their breath and no one really wants to talk about except by saying Doom and Gloom it deserves a wider conversation we deserve to have a more nuanced conversation about what assumptions hold true as AI systems grow in capab ility unless you think that I'm the only one who thinks about this I'm going to call out something that's a small hint that open AI themselves may be thinking a little bit more thoughtfully about how long they have to keep employing people they have recently changed their policy this was in the summer around how they handle stock grants for people who choose to leave the company and long story short they are making it easier for people who leave to continue to get value based on their tenure and the equity that's vested in other words they are expecting a future for a long while to come where people will be employed at open AI for a period and then leave that is a normal employment pattern they are not expecting the end of all things and if they're not expecting it why are we",
