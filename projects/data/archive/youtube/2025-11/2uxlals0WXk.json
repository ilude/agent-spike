  "raw_transcript": "And I think one of the things that makes the tech community that is too bullish on AI unloved and incredibly annoying to other people is the sense from the rest of the world that they just think AI is the way forward. I saw Flame Wars on X which well that's where you go right that's what you get. But I saw Flame Wars on X where people in tech were basically saying none of you get it.
