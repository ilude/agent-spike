And that must come from the leadership team and preferably from the CEO. And by the way, there's not a ton of evidence that AI is actually stealing jobs in aggregate right now. The it's not just me saying that. Ethan Mollik is one of the best known AI uh academics out there. He studied AI extensively. He tweeted as recently as like early July 2025 that there was just not much evidence that AI is actually responsible for significant job attrition. Isolated instances or expectations changing for job roles 100% changing job descriptions. Yes. scaling up, hiring for AI specific roles.",
