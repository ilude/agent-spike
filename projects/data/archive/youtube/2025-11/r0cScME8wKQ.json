  "raw_transcript": "Take take a task like a blog post. Let's say you're you know back in Nate's former chair. You're you're a marketer. We need to write a blog post about sustainable packaging. You can just say, \"Hey, give me five trends in sustainable packaging. Give me a sentence each. Okay, great. Now create a detailed outline for a thousandword article. Okay, great. Write the first paragraph. Help me see your hook. Okay, let's twe twe tweak it. Tweak it. Okay, now I like it. Write section one. Write section two.\" You're going to be done with that blog post in 15 minutes versus two hours. Traditionally, it's a huge savings for SEO type document creation. I will hasten to add it is extremely good at document creation, which may lead you to think it is extremely good at strategy. Those are different things. If you want a good strategic partner, that is not the workflow to go through. You still need to bring your brain if you were doing strategic thinking.",

    "description": "My story: https://open.substack.com/pub/natesnewsletter/p/the-complete-microsoft-ai-copilot?r=1z4sm5&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&showWelcomeOnShare=true\n\nMy site: https://natebjones.com/\nMy links: https://linktr.ee/natebjones\nMy substack: https://natesnewsletter.substack.com/\n\nTakeaways\n 1. Copilot Name Chaos: Microsoft slapped the Copilot brand on twelve different SKUs, so enterprises routinely buy the wrong license and stall adoption.\n 2. Underused Potential: Most teams limit Copilot to email drafts, ignoring high-value workflows like instant pivot tables, meeting-minute generation, and screenshot-based troubleshooting.\n 3. Workflow Mindset: Treat Copilot as \u201cintelligence on tap\u201d across entire processes\u2014prompt chains, cross-app report builds, and Vision-enabled data extraction reclaim hours.\n 4. Cultural Rollout: Small pilots, role champions, shared prompt libraries, and relentless measurement turn isolated wins into organization-wide productivity shifts.\n 5. ROI Stakes: Done right, Copilot saves roughly three hours per worker each week and can return twenty-fold on license spend.\n 6. Future Baseline: Within a year, advanced Copilot fluency will be table stakes; laggards will sacrifice competitive edge.\n\nQuotes\n\u201cCompanies are literally paying for a Ferrari and they are driving it to the grocery store in first gear.\u201d\n\u201cIf AI was as good as it needs to be to take our jobs, I wouldn\u2019t have to make this video.\u201d\n\u201cCopilot mastery is going to look like a basic requirement in about a year.\u201d\n\nSummary\nI spent months interviewing frontline users and dissecting case studies to learn why firms paying six-figure Copilot bills still use it only for drafting email. Microsoft stamped the Copilot name on twelve distinct SKUs, confusing leaders and burying huge gains. I decode each edition, reveal workflows from auto-generated pivot tables to cross-app prompt chains, and spotlight Vodafone\u2019s staged 68,000-seat rollout that recaptured three hours per worker weekly. The takeaway is cultural: pair phased experimentation, role-specific champions, ongoing measurement, transparent wins, and fearless prompt sharing to shift Copilot from novelty to indispensable enterprise leverage\u2014and secure twenty-fold returns on license spend.\n\nKeywords\nMicrosoft Copilot, Copilot SKUs, enterprise AI, workflow automation, prompt libraries, cultural change, Vodafone rollout, email productivity, Excel analysis, pivot tables, ROI",
