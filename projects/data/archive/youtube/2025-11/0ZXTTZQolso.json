  "raw_transcript": "the story of the year is Google and their AI catchup everything else is second place Google started the year as it has been in 2024 I did not spend much time talking about what Google was doing because Google was not doing very much open AI was the story openi was launching stuff anthropic was launching stuff AWS was launching stuff at reinvent and now Google has come and trumped all of that in a matter of a couple weeks and I just blown away this was supposed to be open ai's 12 days of open AI they wanted to take Center Stage here they so far have really failed even though they dropped 01 which is an incredibly powerful reasoning agent well not quite an agent right it's an incredibly powerful reasoning llm and it will probably be an agent as soon as they integrate it into an agent framework in January but for now they're not the center of attention I want to go through nine releases that Google has launched in just the last few days because I want you to remember how much Google is shipping to change the narrative that Google needs to catch up number one Google shipped a new language model Gemini 2.0 it's absolutely incredible it is a state-of-the-art language model it's incredibly fast it is so fast they are having to ask the flash model to slow down people are writing into Google saying this whole idea of streaming text is breaking because Google Gemini 2.0 flash is too fast it's too fast imagine asking your product to slow down I've never had that happen they launched Willow a Quantum ship that shows error reduction as you add cubits which is an absolutely massive development they launched video FX that was just yesterday video FX is hands down better than Sora right now and people are being shy about that but I won't be because I have seen the video comparison if you pick the correct prompt a prompt that requires multiple parts of the video to work in parallel like a real world model does it is clear which one actually understands the real world and can produce good video better and it's video FX they also call the model itself V2 ve2 so if you see that floating around it's the same model here's an example prompt that I saw a chef cutting a piece of steak with steam rising from the piece of steak sounds simple easy to describe but if you have to visualize that with a video you have to have the knife moving correctly through the meat the texture needs to feel right so the knife is cutting appropriately not too easily you have to have the piece of meat moving just jiggling slightly in the right way in parallel with the knife as you saw at it you have to have the steam rising from the right parts of the meat clearly you have to have the hand working correctly with the knife there's a lot the only one I saw that worked was video FX and look that was just release number three there's nine of these image FX it's a mid Journey killer it's a mid Journey killer and you know it is because mid Journey's founder went on Twitter and got very depressed and defensive about how he thinks he's running a great company which by the way I love Med journey I still use M journey I do think it's a great product so nothing against M Journey but for casual users who want to generate images the tools that Google is launching are just not even close like they're so much easier you don't have to go to a Discord with image FX you just go to Google labs and you start playing around and you type and you see images it's what it should be and I'm not even getting to whisk whisk wasn't on my list of nine whisk is a cute little play toy for kids where you upload a couple of photos and you put them together and you can make like a sticker looking thing right like they just threw that out there like hey we've also got this music FX there's also a DJ product that they dropped I haven't even had time to play with it it's like what I do to play with AI stuff and Google's launching so much I don't even have time for it deep research absolutely incredible I do wish they would increase the token limit on this it will survey so many different sites in a short period of time it it literally Cuts research Time by tens of hours it's like a 10x saver on Research it's accurate citation is going to transform Academia in 2025 and the only thing stopping it from being a complete Banger is that it limits you to about five pages of output I think they're going to fix that it's it's amazing that was the feature that made me sign right back up for a paid Gemini subscription I needed the Deep research notebook LM plus so they launched notebook LM now they're refining it new interface chance to talk with the host notebook LM plus they're they're not just shipping and forgetting anymore they're actually shipping improvements Astra so Astra is a situationally aware AI agent where you can go in and say Hey you talk to your phone you talk to your Google pixel and say hey uh what are what are the lanterns hanging on the temple up there and as will answer or hey what does this sign say in Japanese uh I'm going to the train station and it will tell you if it's going to the train station or not that's what Astra is for it's that sort of situationally aware look through the camera tell you what's going on by the way Gemini is using Astra I think with the uh live streaming feature where it live streams off your laptop or off your phone and you can actually see what's going on and talk to Gemini very similar thing so it launched Astra that's for consumers and then it also launched Mariner which is agentic browsing like book my tickets when I take my next trip all of that in the space of just a few days Google is back and I think that one of the things that's going to be a major storyline in 202 is with Google's momentum where it is are the capital reserves that Google brings to the table enough to enable it to win the market in 2025 in a way that open AI has been unable to do they haven't raised the funds for their GPT 6 training run they are rumored to be having trouble doing that if they run into funding issues that could have ramifications for Microsoft's whole position in the AI space it's really really interesting it doesn't mean Microsoft is done by any means don't count them out but Google is shipping in a way that none of the other major players are so congrats whoever whoever's shipping at Google well done very excited love the quality um and I'm excited to see what's ahead cheers",
