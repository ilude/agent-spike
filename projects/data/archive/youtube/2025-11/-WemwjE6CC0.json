In other words, part of your job with this model and part of what I'm going to be doing in the coming days is digging into when and how you prompt these models for the kind of task that you have in front of you. These people who say that prompting doesn't matter have not played with this model. This is getting harder and harder and harder to prompt. It is getting trickier to prompt. Yes, if you are doing casual work and you just want to gesture vaguely at a piece of work and you're not too worried about it, it has never been easier to prompt. That is true. It has never been easier to say, \"I want an itinerary for Japan.\" And just gesture vaguely at it. It will come up with something. So, that part is easy. But getting really complex work done, doing something like what I gave it where correctness matters, accuracy matters, the documents don't agree. It's a very complex context window. That takes",
