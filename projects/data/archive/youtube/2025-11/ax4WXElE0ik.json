Staging environment, Canary deployments, feature flags, sort of a slow roll out to see how the effect goes. Nope. Apparently, push it to main YOLO and let it rip. Just think about that for a second. This is a system that can reach hundreds of millions of users. And they're treating the prompts more like a personal blog that they can hotfix, which they had to do after the fiasco on the ETH. As far as I can tell, what they're doing here violates the principles of modern production software deployment. You need version control on your deployments. You need rollback procedures.
