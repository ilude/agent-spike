  "raw_transcript": "Recently, in the last year or so, they've been able to read Excel. Outputting Excel is still sketchy. If I go to 03 and I say, \"Hey, 03, make me an Excel.\" Doesn't go very well. It doesn't know how to like write formulas down. But the problem is this. There is a difference between being able to build a simple four or five tab spreadsheet, I don't know, a dozen rows of information, a dozen columns of information on each tab, and being able to tackle the multi-,000 row spreadsheet from hell that keeps most marketing teams going. I've had to maintain that spreadsheet. I know what they're like. I would not give that to this tool. It would be like the intern ordering the cupcakes, but worse, because then you don't know how to back up. There is no undo function on what operator is",

    "description": "My site: https://natebjones.com\nMy substack: https://natesnewsletter.substack.com/\n\nTakeaways\n 1. Hype vs Reality: Agent Mode behaves like an \u201cover-thinking intern,\u201d delivering less autonomy and speed than the marketing suggests.\n 2. Excel Automation Edge: Its most credible win is auto-building straightforward Excel models, finally closing AI\u2019s long-standing spreadsheet gap for finance teams.\n 3. Mandatory Babysitting: Heavy guardrails force constant user approval, slowing work and revealing OpenAI\u2019s priority to limit liability over efficiency.\n 4. Prompt-Injection Risk: Sam Altman admits a simple email can hijack the agent\u2014spotlighting a new, highly exploitable attack surface.\n 5. Data-Harvest Strategy: OpenAI is shipping early to collect real-world usage data, effectively turning users into test subjects for a decade-long general agent project.\n 6. Specialized Beats General (for now): Narrow, task-focused agents\u2014like code or calendaring bots\u2014still deliver more day-to-day value than this broad but cumbersome tool.\n\nQuotes\n\u201cWe are all guinea pigs in OpenAI\u2019s decade-long quest to build a general-purpose agent.\u201d\n\u201cAll you get when you give deep research arms and legs is an over-thinking intern.\u201d\n\u201cAn agent I have to babysit isn\u2019t an assistant; it\u2019s another task.\u201d\n\nSummary\nI argue that OpenAI\u2019s new Agent Mode, despite the hype, behaves like an over-thinking intern: it can build simple Excel models and rudimentary decks but demands constant supervision, slows work, and invites liability. Guardrails force repeated hand-offs, and Sam Altman admits the system remains vulnerable to prompt-injection hijacks, making email triage risky. Finance professionals may glean value from automated spreadsheet creation, yet most users will see limited day-to-day payoff. OpenAI is effectively using us as guinea pigs to gather data for a decade-long quest toward a true general-purpose agent; until then, specialized task-focused agents will deliver more practical gains.\n\nKeywords\nOpenAI, Agent Mode, general-purpose agent, Excel automation, guardrails, prompt injection, supervised AI, finance workflows, intern analogy, data collection, Sam Altman, liability, specialized agents",
