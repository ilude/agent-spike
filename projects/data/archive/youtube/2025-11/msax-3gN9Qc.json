  "raw_transcript": "I think we're desperately in need of new paradigms to relate to artificial intelligence that's a lot of what underlies the questions I tend to get that are really tough that start off hard so what's going to happen to my job is a I going to take it is AI going to take all the jobs is AI going to become Skynet is AI going to be something that recommends terrifying changes to our economy is say I going to control things in ways that aren't aligned to human interest I could go on what we really need is a new way of understanding what we're dealing with with artificial intelligence we need and I know this is going to sound academic we need a new anthropology of artificial intelligence a way of understanding this this sense that the rocks have begun to think a new philosophical approach if you will so I was inspired by a GitHub essay that I link here in the post called the computer is a Feeling and it was really like written a couple of years ago before AI became as big as it is now and it wasn't about AI it was about Computing which is a much uh older Concept in a lot of ways and I walked away from that really appreciating the clarity it's just 20 lines it's extremely easy to understand you can read the whole thing in about two minutes and you get a sense of a whole new perspective on what Computing is that's what I wanted to create with this essay on AI I wanted people to walk away with a sense of what AI can be and how we can relate to AI differently I write really long blog posts sometimes this is not one of those this is a blog post that's really focused on explaining very clearly a new kind of perspective we can have on artificial intelligence that I think will help us if we really take it in to prompt better to have a more clear sense of where AI is useful and where it's not of the work that's needed to enable AI to do good good and useful things that are aligned with human goals as you can probably tell if you read this blog I'm kind of an AI Optimist I don't try and hide that but I also don't hide the hard work that goes into Ai and I think we have to change the way we think about AI in order to effectively understand how to work with it and this is that sort of more philosophical take so sit back enjoy share it with an anthropology student you know share it with someone who's wondering what AI is and how it's changing Computing because I think it's important to understand that and take a second to think about it",
