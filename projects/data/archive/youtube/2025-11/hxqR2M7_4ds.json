If you are an engineer, I would encourage you when you're sharing about your cloud code projects. Yes, talk about how amazing Claude is where it illustrates the token burn and it's really smart at actually executing what you want and it has a high follow through. You can talk about the caveats and the drawbacks in certain situations. It is unfortunate that you can't see the code that you're writing. Right? I'm not saying it replaces everything, but also mention if you're an engineer or you're a regular user of claude code that this is not just a coding agent. It is more than that. is effectively a general purpose agent that lives in your terminal.",
