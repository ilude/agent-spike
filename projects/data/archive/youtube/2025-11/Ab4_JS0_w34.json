  "raw_transcript": "That may be true, but I think what Girkley misses is the trustbreaking nature of this choice. There has been an implicit contract in the valley where founders are in it for the long haul with their companies. If that starts to break down because the AI salary pressures are so insane that it is better to be an employee than to be a founder at a major R&D firm like Google for AI. We have cracks in the Silicon Valley ecosystem. It does not sit well with me that a founder would be rewarded for walking away from their startup and leaving their employees in the lurch. So as much as I agree with Gurgaly that on paper this is better than the outcome the company could have had I don't think it is a good thing that builds trust in the ecosystem long term. I think it's negative for the ecosystem. I don't think Google did a service to the valley here and I get maybe why they felt they had to do it because Google unlike smaller startups like OpenAI would not be under FTC scrutiny the way Google is. And so Google had to tread very carefully and that may be part of why the aqua hire deal happened. But we aren't done yet. By the evening, Logan at Google, Logan Kilpatrick, tweets a welcome and everything is official. Controversy starts to explode. Details of the structure leak on July 12th, Saturday. The 2.4 billion leaks. Vested employees got cash payouts. Employees with less than 12 months tenure get nothing which is actually very typical in startups and the remaining company has no core team which I discussed. In the afternoon on Saturday it's announced that Jeff Wang will be the interim CEO. The company states their SAS focus will continue and emphasizes the Google license is not an exclusive. Social media explodes. Uh lot of commentary on employees counting out sort of their rewards they were going to get and then getting nothing. Uh channel partners begin to pull support for for Windinsurf. # Windinssurf betrayal starts to trend. By July 13th, Sunday, more internal details leak. Apparently, there was a rambling CEO Zoom speech announcing the deal. Employee anger begins to peak. By the afternoon, industry analysts are weighing in. predictions of bankruptcy within 12 months. Remaining company called a zombie. Enterprise customers advised to migrate. This is all very bad. If you are still at Windsurf, right, for the 250 employees, this has been a weekend from hell. And I I cannot emphasize this enough. I would not want to be you guys. I I am hoping that you are in a better spot now. And we're going to get to why. July 14th, Monday, Cognition Labs, the makers of Devon, announce an acquisition of the remaining parts of Windsurf. This includes their IP, their product, their trademark, their brand, their training data, and all remaining 250.",
