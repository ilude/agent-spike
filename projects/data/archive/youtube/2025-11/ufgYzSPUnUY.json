And if something goes wrong and they forget the skill or they can't call the skill reliably, they will just go to the next best thing, never tell you, and do their best to make it work. You have to be intentional at discovering what skills work, how those skills work, and then think carefully about the prompts you construct to insist on workflow enforcement. If this sounds like systems thinking, I warned you it is. But I'm doing a lot of the work for you on the prompt creation here. And I I want to remind you that this is systems thinking once to save you boatloads of time down the",
