  "raw_transcript": "Imagine an agent that allows you to simulate various business timelines and explore them. We often only have the chance for a simple PowerPoint presentation to the board with three options and here's our preferred one. I gives us so much more power to work with and almost none of us are using these agents as reality simulators to think through different timelines in a structured way. In that world, if we did a little structured timeline exploration for a business, we could turn a 10-year market cycle into a 10-hour sim and come back with five or six different 10-hour sims and have a much more useful understanding of where the business was going. In a sense, we're taking all of these timelines that we've had to historically just look the next two or three steps on. We now have the compute to simulate a bunch of those different lines, bring them in and make smarter decisions.",
