  "raw_transcript": "We are living in a world where the cost of intelligence really is going to zero and it gives individuals an immense amount of agency to choose your own adventure. Your ability to form intent and go after something with clarity, focus and dedication has never had more leverage because the intelligence is going to get better and better and cheaper and cheaper. We are in a world where you can teach yourself any skill you want with the help of AI in just a few months. And so it's going to be on individuals to go after what they want. And the ability is not going to be evenly distributed. What I'm finding is that even though everyone has access to these models, very few folks are making the most of them. And so the willingness to jump on and make the most of not just frontier models but potentially cheaper next generation models that are adjacent to the frontier. The willingness to understand these strategic constraints and think about the opportunities that you have. That is rare and we're probably one of the few that is paying attention to the strategic themes in AI right",

Here's the TLDR, what's most surprising, and the realities AI builders everywhere will face in 2025 and 2026. \n\nIn this video, I share the inside scoop on the shift from model IQ to systems\u2014capability-to-cost, distribution, and power constraints\u2014and what it means for LLMs like GPT-5, Claude, and Gemini:\n\u2022 Why the capability-to-cost curve resets unit economics every few months.\n\u2022 How routing to the cheapest capable model beats frontier defaults.\n\u2022 What answer engines mean for distribution and AEO in the browser.\n\u2022 Where power, permits, and water will bottleneck LLM scale.\n\nChapters:\n00:00 The State of AI Report Overview\n04:56 Drivers of AI Systems: Cost, Distribution, and Infrastructure\n12:39 Evaluating AI Reasoning Gains and Model Intelligence\n17:39 Open vs Closed Models: The Global AI Landscape\n22:48 Implications for AI Builders and Investors\n25:56 The Future of AI: Individual Agency and Opportunities\n\nFor operators, advantage now comes from multi-model routing, answer-engine optimization, and clear-eyed planning for infrastructure limits\u2014balancing upside in automation at work and AI agents with real execution risk.\n\nSubscribe for daily AI strategy and news.\nFor deeper playbooks and analysis: https://natesnewsletter.substack.com/",
