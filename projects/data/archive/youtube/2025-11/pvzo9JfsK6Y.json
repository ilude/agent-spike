  "raw_transcript": "I really like it when we get new modalities that we can talk about new interfaces that we can talk about for tasks that are truly AI native so writing is one of those tasks it's moved from I think about it in my brain I do all the work in my brain I write it down which was our whole world until 20122 to now I work with AI I partner with AI but we don't have good modalities to support that what I mean by that is the chatbot kind of sucks like I have to sit there and type it in and what I find is I'm not happy with just the output of the chatbot and a lot of people will tell you on the internet well that's because the chatbot is bad and you have to edit it extensively and all of that what I do is I actually have like three or four different AI sources running at the same time and I'm mixing and matching them there's a lot of copy pasting so I go to perplexity I get a bunch of sources I paste that into Chad gp40 and I get something going with that then I ask 01 to think about it and look at it then I say this doesn't feel clean muscular Pros I need to one voice it I bring it over to Claude Sonet 3.5 to try and one voice this is getting complicated right like there's a lot of copy and pasting going back and forth so I would love to have a world that was simpler and what I found is that Lex actually offers that so Lex is a kind of little known tool but it's entirely focused on text it's like it's Reinventing what word is and I got a sneak peek at a new feature they're bringing that really underlines how you can have a different ux modality when it comes to writing so they are introducing context tags context tags are this idea that you can evoke an entire piece of context for your writing like a variable in code so if you're just kind of going along and you're like I want to write something with this this this and this you can just tag in context tags and it Imports all of that context into the document and what I love about that is I have the option to essentially use a recipe to write an article now I can say I want it in this style and I evoke a context tag I've built for that style I want it with this research and I evoke a context tag I filled in for that research I want it with this length and audience and I evoke a context tag for that I want it with this set of core insights that I've veloped I have it all I can just context tag it in and then I can remix reuse adjust those context tags as I go and it's super fast especially if you're writing blog posts multiple times if you're kind of in the same content stream and you're reusing those content context tags it just runs quick and instead of me having to keep all of that in my head and repeat it or copy and paste prompts in it just goes fast and Lex lets you switch between models in the same flow so I don't have to like copy and paste into CLA and into open AI Etc it's just right there I just switch the model and keep going so I love it I also love the little touches they bring like when they're editing they actually show you red strikethroughs for deletions green for additions it's very easy to see how the model is working with the text you can do contextual editing in pieces um I think context tags are coming out for everyone in the next week or so I got a sneak peek I love them uh I'm going to put a link to an article I wrote using five or so different context tags just to show you what it looks like it's on writing and how writing is changing because that's what this is about uh I'll put that in the YouTube description uh you can feel free to check it out I would love to hear from you what are other new kinds of modalities or interfaces that you have seen that feel truly AI native that work with how our brains are now working now that we have artificial intelligence as a partner for these kinds of tasks like to me what Lex is doing feels a little bit analogous to what cursor has been doing or wind surf has been doing for coding but they're doing it for writing so I'm curious what you guys think and I would love to hear more examples of interfaces like that cheers",

    "description": "about me: https://natebjones.com/\nLex: https://lex.page/\nMy note on how writing is changing: https://lex.page/read/b54cc283-525f-4000-b939-399684abf2a7\nLook at Lex on youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoCzf--j8uQ\n\nTakeaways:\n 1. Writing as AI Partnership: Writing has evolved from a solitary task to a collaborative process with AI, shifting from pure generation to orchestration.\n 2. Frustrations with Chatbots: Current AI workflows rely heavily on chatbots, which are cumbersome and require significant manual input and editing.\n 3. Lex\u2019s Context Tags: Lex introduces context tags, allowing writers to quickly evoke style, research, and insights as reusable variables, streamlining the writing process.\n 4. Multi-Model Integration: Lex allows seamless switching between AI models in the same interface, eliminating the need for external tools and copy-pasting.\n 5. Intuitive Editing Tools: Features like strikethroughs for deletions and green highlights for additions provide clarity and improve the editing experience.\n 6. Future of AI Modalities: Lex\u2019s approach is analogous to tools like Cursor for coding, but focused on writing, showing the potential for AI-native interfaces in diverse fields.\n 7. Call for Better UX: The transcript highlights the need for more AI-native modalities that align with human workflows and cognitive processes.\n\nQuotes:\n \u2022 \u201cWriting isn\u2019t dying\u2014it\u2019s evolving into a partnership with AI, shifting from generation to orchestration.\u201d\n \u2022 \u201cLex\u2019s context tags let me tag in style, research, and audience instantly, making writing faster and more seamless.\u201d\n \u2022 \u201cWe need AI-native interfaces that work with how our brains collaborate with AI, not against them.\u201d\n\nSummary:\nThe writing process has shifted dramatically, evolving into a collaborative effort between humans and AI. Current tools, like chatbots, struggle to support this partnership due to inefficiencies in workflows. Lex emerges as a game-changing writing tool with features like context tags, which allow writers to reuse and remix key elements like style and research seamlessly. Its ability to switch between AI models within a single interface eliminates the need for manual copy-pasting, while intuitive editing tools simplify revisions. The transcript underscores the need for more AI-native modalities that align with human cognition and workflows, fostering creativity and efficiency.\n\nKeywords:\nwriting, AI-native, Lex, context tags, OpenAI, Claude, ChatGPT, collaboration, AI workflows, UX modalities, Cursor, Windsurf, multi-model integration, automation, editing tools, innovation, research, AI partnership, creative tools, productivity, artificial intelligence",
