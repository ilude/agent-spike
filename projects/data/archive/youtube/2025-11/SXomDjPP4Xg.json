  "raw_transcript": "We're talking about pride of ownership today. And I know you might think AI, Nate is an AI guy. I promise you this gets back to AI. At the end of the day, most of the conflicts we see in our public institutions and in the private workplace are about how we handle pride of ownership in an AI world. And I want to take you through a brief tour of the before times so you get a sense of how much has changed and how our underlying frameworks have not shifted because I think that gives us the ability to show where we need to advance our work culture, our educational culture to truly make AI a useful tool. We begin before AI. We had three implicit questions that we asked every time in work, at school, if we took pride of ownership in something. It is, did you author it? Do you truly know the material? Can you show me the chain of provenence for this material? That happens with property and transactions, but it also happens with work. Can you show me the reviews it went through? It was a conversation I've had about mini docks. Professors have asked how many books I read. They're implicitly asking about the chain of providence of the idea. So, show me that you can keep the idea and have a sense of integrity there. And finally, can you show that you have ownership on outcomes? If you're in class, it's do you have ownership on the grade? If you are at work, it's do you have ownership of your KPIs? The point is those questions are not new. We have been asking those questions since Ian Nir complained about his copper shipments because someone was not upholding their end of the agreement and not taking pride in their work. And yes, I am making a very nerdy reference and I hope someone appreciates it. The point here is that those underlying components of pride of ownership will not change in the age of AI. They won't. Stop expecting them to. When you get into a fight, whether it's in uh at school, whether it's at work, whatever your context about whether AI is appropriate to use, it almost always comes down to pride of ownership. You need to be able to answer all three of those questions affirmatively in order to have a positive communal AI productivity experience. And I know that sounds weird like it's very hippie to say it that way but fundamentally when we use AI onetoone where I am talking to the AI if I am doing so in the context of group work the group is affected and demands to know what's going on implicitly or explicitly and if they feel like they don't the instinct of a lot of groups is to clamp down and so if you were in an environment like that you have to recognize those are the three questions people are asking is do you know your work? Can you keep your work? Do you understand the chain of providence? And can you be responsible for the outcomes? Can you hang your hat on what happens afterward? Those are the things that work is expecting. And I believe we can answer yes on those in the age of AI. It's not impossible. You can do it. You can in fact use AI to prompt and ask yourself questions of the data that you have at your disposal. So you know your product area, so you know your domain, so you know your educational subject matter better. You can actually increase your product knowledge. Yes is a spectrum and you can be more yes on product knowledge or domain knowledge if you use AI well. And so in a sense, part of the interesting thing about AI is that people tend to assume you can use AI as a cheat sheet and skip the product knowledge part. But it doesn't have to be that way. It can be the reverse. Similarly, with provenence, you can be transparent about where you are using, evolving, and thinking about your arguments. Sometimes that's as simple as saying, \"Chat GPT and I have been working on this together.\" Sometimes that's as simple as saying this is an argument. I evolved it after this conversation. Then I processed it through chat GPT and I used this prompt and came back. And that more formal sense might be appropriate if legal might get involved. There are cases now where documents are being created with legal implications inside workspaces and you have to have some providence and that may include the prompts. But even if you're not that formal, it is still appropriate to understand for yourself how you gained conviction in a space. And I think that's the heart of it. And so maybe it's not about logging all your prompts and this and that, although maybe that's a best practice. It's about is your workspace and the artifacts you're leaving behind in a position where a stranger who is fluent in the art could come in, look at the workspace, look at the artifacts and evolve to a place of similar high conviction that you have about your angle of approach on your work. Does that make sense? It's like could they look at what you have left behind and gain a sense of conviction because you have left enough behind that there's a bit of a chain of providence on your thinking. That's what keeping means to me. That's keeping your thinking. Finally on outcomes that I I think that has changed the least in the age of AI like at the end of the day you are still accountable for the KPIs and there is still a gut level accountability to say it's on me the grade for the essay it's on me if you're an education the performance of the team it's on me if you're a manager that kind of thing that level of commitment is not different than it was before, but people sometimes think you're going to skip it because they think that people will depend on AI and then blame AI. I got news for you. You you just cannot blame the machine. It's the old the old joke from the IBM slide that a machine can't make managerial decisions. Well, joking aside, it's still kind of true from a human perspective. Humans expect humans to own and be accountable. So you got to be accountable. And that's as old as taking accountability for your copper imports. And I am just going full nerd here. I hope someone appreciates it. So there you go. It's about making sure that you are responsible for knowing your domain, keeping the providence of your work in an artifact form that people can understand how you evolve conviction, and you're responsible for your outcomes. That's true before AI and that's true with AI. And I think if we understood that and we talked about that more, we would have fewer arguments about when and where to use chat GPT or co-pilot because they would be grounded in what's really going on, which is an agreement in how we work. We need to reforge those agreements in how we work. And I think that framework is a way to think about it. Cheers.",

Pride of Ownership Framework Persists: Three timeless questions\u2014Do you know the material, can you trace its provenance, and will you own the outcome?\u2014still govern trust in any work, AI-assisted or not.\n 2. Root Cause of AI Conflicts: Most battles over ChatGPT or Copilot are really about unanswered pride-of-ownership concerns, not the tech itself.\n 3. AI as Knowledge Amplifier: Used well, AI deepens product or domain expertise instead of replacing it, turning \u201cyes\u201d to \u201cmore yes\u201d on true understanding.\n 4. Provenance Transparency Builds Trust: Explicitly logging prompts or at least describing how AI shaped your draft lets teammates reconstruct your reasoning and gain conviction.\n 5. Accountability Remains Human: KPIs, grades, and final decisions are still ours; blaming the model is a non-starter.\n 6. Artifact-Driven Conviction: Leave enough behind\u2014notes, prompts, iterations\u2014so a newcomer can follow the trail and reach the same confidence you hold.\n\nQuotes:\n\u201cWhen you fight about AI at work, it\u2019s almost always a fight about pride of ownership.\u201d\n\u201cHumans expect humans to own the outcomes\u2014you can\u2019t blame the machine.\u201d\n\u201cCould a stranger walk into your workspace, follow your artifacts, and arrive at the same conviction? That\u2019s the real test.\u201d\n\nSummary:\nI argue that most workplace conflicts about AI are really conflicts about pride of ownership. Whether before or after AI, people still ask three things: Do you truly know the material, can you trace its provenance, and will you own the outcome? AI doesn\u2019t excuse us from these duties; used well, it can deepen them. It expands product knowledge, documents thought processes, and still leaves humans responsible for KPIs and grades. A workspace that preserves prompts and iterations lets any newcomer rebuild the same conviction. Re-forging work agreements around these principles allows organizations to adopt AI confidently, effectively, and successfully.\n\nKeywords:\npride of ownership, AI, authorship, provenance, accountability, work culture, chain of provenance, product knowledge, transparency, KPIs, AI adoption",
