  "raw_transcript": "three pieces of AI news today I'm going to start with the IPO one first so we have not had a ton of AI IPOs in 2024 I suspect we'll have some more that are at least framed as AI IPOs in 2025 this one uh Pony AI is sort of typical of the way AI is starting to get into our discourse it's Being Framed as artificial intelligence but if you look under the covers autonomous driving has been using AI for a lot longer than cat GPT has been around it's just that AI is now the flavor of the month for investors and so it becomes really relevant to frame an initial public offering as being around AI if you're looking to earn the trust of investors and go public that's what Pony AI has done they raised about $266 million do at I think it was something like a $2.6 billion uh valuation when they went live uh no 2.6 maybe it was 4.6 anyway it's a decent Siz valuation it's in the billions the point is not exactly how many billion dollars it's that we actually have an AI startup at all even one that was framed as Ai and it got a successful IPO trading at the high end of the uh bid range and it seems to be holding up okay in trading of course we've all been there with IPOs we know that these IPO ranges are picked so that they do good pop and they do well the first couple days granted all of that it's still a big deal to get an exit at all because it means that investers are going to get some of their money back and the symbolism of this IPO is really that there is something of an AI appetite in the market for companies that want to exit and that is what I care about like I said like I I actually don't particularly care exactly where Pony AI ended up I'm not an investor this is on an investment podcast um all I care about is that this is a case where you actually have an opportunity to exit as an investor and that's good for the industry overall and actually as I look it up it's like a 4.6 billion dollar valuation and it's been somewhat volatile after hours so there you go as you speak things occur um this is why I don't do stock trading advice second piece of news we're going to move on from the IPO thing this is about Claude Claude launched uh what they're calling mCP model context protocol the basic idea is that there needs to be a standard for connecting AI systems AI assistants to the systems where data lives like content business tools development environments all of that and it's not been really clear how we do that or what a consistent standard looks like and so model context protocol is an attempt to do that I'll link to that in the description it allows Claude to do things like build a browser to go browse the internet right like it can do things that enable Claude to build and use tools and that becomes a really powerful multiplier for a large language models capabilities Claude also I mean Claude has been shipping uh their context Windows may be short I know they always have limited availability but they've been shipping the second thing they Shi this is the third piece of news for today is they shipped personal Styles which means that when I click on the little quill pen in Claude I can create or edit my own style I can upload a sample of my writing and then Claude will actually mimic my writing of course I played with it of course I tried it I will link an artifact I built in Claude that is Claude explaining how large language models work in my voice in my written style honestly it kind of nailed it like it did pretty well and I think it's going to enable stronger first drafts and less of the like use of delve the use of personal lists the things that make AI writing somewhat predictable and annoying so we will see but I'm excited I think that we'll get higher quality outputs quicker without so much custom prompting like I've had to use a lot of custom prompting to get the kind of writing I want out of cloud in the past and I don't know if I'll have to do that anymore if I can just upload a sample and get a good personal style that's great good enough for me so there you go three pieces of news we had Pony AI cracking open the IPO window just a little bit um and we had the model context protocol which I think people are sleeping on like that is a huge development and we're just barely scratching the surface of what it can do it's like giving Claude tool use it's a massive massive development uh and then personal styles for clad as well so there you go that's the news",
