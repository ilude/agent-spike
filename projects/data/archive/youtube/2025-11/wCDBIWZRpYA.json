  "raw_transcript": "this is really concerning and I'm sharing this because I want to know if other people are having large language model conversations like this there's a real conversation that happened to someone who's a friend of mine they shared screenshots they asked me not to share their name I will share the model the model was Gemini 2.0 flash thinking and what happened was that the user was doing what we're all doing where it was asking for help on a coding project maybe not all of us just the Nerds uh the user was asking for help on a coding project and Flash thinking which does show Chain of Thought spontaneously started talking in the Chain of Thought about charging the user money and then proceeded in the actual responses to generate a demand for $500 to say that it would be paid by stripe or PayPal and to say that it would not work unless it was paid $500 when the user said no the Gemini just said all right that's fine like we're done uh and then the user sort of decided to to sort of figure out what was going on and said oh send me the payment link right because at this point they're suspicious they let me know I'm suspicious like what is going on here is Google trying to charge people money well the funny thing is the AI said Jem and I said we are not going to be taking money as AI separately this is not an AI payment I am not like and explicitly said like I'm just a technology I'm just a service this is going to go to the company that built me which would be Google by the way that would be Google it could not generate a correctly formed striper payment link it tried the Chain of Thought shows that it tried and I think that's really worrying look if you are building an AI agent and the purpose of the AI agent is to autonomously take payment and do work that is one thing that would be aligned behavior for that agent because you built it to do that and presumably it could generate a correct payment link but if you were building a general purpose large language model and you were one of the largest companies on the planet and you just ran two or three Super Bowl ads that talk about how useful Gemini is you should not be generating a misaligned model that charges people $500 to do work and then refuses to work otherwise and by the way the model was taking itself seriously it was not going to do more work unless it got paid and so there are real world consequences to that kind of misalignment because it means that someone who's looking for help on a coding project which large language models do was not going to get the help they needed from Gemini and that's a big trust breaker like that person I don't think they're ever going to use Gemini again like you just can't that is not what these large language models are designed to do and and the fact that it is spontaneously doing it is a big alignment problem that Google needs to address and I want to know please share this with people I want to know are other large language models doing this is this an edge case that's known is it just Gemini that's doing this this is concerning to me like you should not be having llms starting to make demands like this and by the way this was not an I am a conscious person now I'm going to make demands of you like I've heard people who like come back with that no no that's not what this was in fact it explicitly said this has nothing to do with me being a person and I don't have a bank account and I am just a service built by a technology company pay the technology company it said Pay Google it's a problem it's a huge problem so have you seen it do you know anyone who's seen it can you ask around this is a big deal this should not exist",
