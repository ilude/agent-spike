  "raw_transcript": "who actually one of the things that's never been easier is to stretch your brain because you have a thinking partner in AI. I'm not suggesting that you do this by throwing pencils at the wall the oldfashioned way the way I used to. I'm suggesting you use AI as a partner and that's why I did a whole write up with all of the prompts because I want you to be able to understand how to use AI as a thinking partner in this exercise. And I want you to feel like the tools that you have, the prompts that you have can be combined with a philosophy of entrepreneurship in the AI age that actually sticks. And so just just to recap so you don't forget if you're starting, one, this is a unique moment. Code is easier to create than ever. It won't last forever. Micro niches are a big part of that. Software was a blunt hammer before. Three, please, please remember to go for distribution. Make sure that you put distribution at the heart of your strategy, or else you're going to regret",
