  "raw_transcript": "who actually one of the things that's never been easier is to stretch your brain because you have a thinking partner in AI. I'm not suggesting that you do this by throwing pencils at the wall the oldfashioned way the way I used to. I'm suggesting you use AI as a partner and that's why I did a whole write up with all of the prompts because I want you to be able to understand how to use AI as a thinking partner in this exercise. And I want you to feel like the tools that you have, the prompts that you have can be combined with a philosophy of entrepreneurship in the AI age that actually sticks. And so just just to recap so you don't forget if you're starting, one, this is a unique moment. Code is easier to create than ever. It won't last forever. Micro niches are a big part of that. Software was a blunt hammer before. Three, please, please remember to go for distribution. Make sure that you put distribution at the heart of your strategy, or else you're going to regret",

    "description": "What\u2019s really happening with building an AI-powered side gig?\nThe usual advice is super generic: \"AI makes building a side gig easier than ever\"\u2014sure. \n\nBut HOW? What's the actual advantage now? Why? How do YOU leverage that advantage to build an AI side gig that actually stands a chance of making money?\n\nIn this video, I share the inside scoop on launching an AI-native side gig that actually ships:\n\u2022 Why LLMs open a short-lived micro-niche window\u2014and how to spot it.\n\u2022 How to choose distribution-first micro markets you already know and serve.\n\u2022 What tool stack ships fast: Lovable.dev, Outseta, Framer, Gemini\u2014no heroics.\n\u2022 Where to draw the line: ruthless scope, square-deal pricing, real traction.\n\nFor solo builders, the window is real but short; choose a niche you know, keep scope tight, and let distribution\u2014not features\u2014decide.\n\nSubscribe for daily AI strategy and news.\nFor deeper playbooks and analysis: https://natesnewsletter.substack.com/",
