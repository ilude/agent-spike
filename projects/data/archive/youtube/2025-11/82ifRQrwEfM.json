  "raw_transcript": "news moves fast over the weekend Manis AI became a huge thing across the AI world and I'm going to explain you what it is basically Manis is like if deep research was crossed with claw and that's not an accident because later in the weekend so this all came out Friday right men has dropped their release video they're a Chinese startup they came out and shared a lot about sort of what they're accomplishing and why they're doing it and their p passion for sort of making this more available to people they had a killer demo video where I think they were managing like 26 social Accounts at once using Manis and I thought well we'll have to see how this goes right um well it turns out that Manis is a really fancy rapper for Claude and that came out by Sunday and so someone figured out how to drop out sort of the tool set for Manis and what it looks like is that it's Claude Sonic with I think 30 different tools that it can call and the results are real like the the system is slow it takes a really long time sometimes it errors out which I think is just scaling issues for the team they're trying to get those chips in as quick as they can but it does work uh it produces uh highly detailed results uh stuff that's on par with 03 uh and deep research and everyone is super assumed at the beginning of the weekend that that was because it was a new model that the Chinese lab had built but it turns out it was Claude Sonet and what the team had done is actually agen toy Claude Sonet they'd given it this wide range of uh tool sets that that Claude could use they'd given it special instructions and they'd wrapped it up and that's Manis so we'll see how long that lasts um I'm not sure if the terms of service for Claude include commercializing Claude and calling it something else um and I'm not sure how enforceable that would be uh under Chinese jurisdiction for Claud anyway that's a question for the lawyers um and it is possible that more of the story will come out and people will say oh no no it wasn't you know it wasn't really claw they have something different um so we'll see it's it's an emerging conversation I think the think I I think the thing that is most interesting to me is that I was not surprised when I heard that it was clawed in 30 Tools in other words we have reached the point in the AI Revolution where if someone tells you I'm using an existing an existing intelligence but I gave it new tools and it can do something absolutely incredible it can create a 75 page document on a new medical treatment for multiple sclerosis which was one of the things that it actually did over the weekend um I'm not surprised I'm no surprise and that's where we're at and it underscores to me that we talk a lot here about how quickly intelligence is scaling and rightly so but what we don't talk about as much is the intelligence we already have can go a long way with a little bit better tooling and I wonder if part of the agent age in 2025 is going to be essentially taking the intelligence that we've got which is already very good and putting wheels on it right giving it tooling giving it the chance to actually go out and get something done so we will see how the story of Madness unfolds a bit more uh I'll probably be writing more on it talking more about it it's a big story uh it's very very difficult to get performance like deep research congrats to the team however they did it um it's an achievement regardless and sort of we'll see where we go from here good luck with the scaling guys",
