  "raw_transcript": "It's not the ability to write the code that is transformative. It's the ability to think about the structure of the project and how to order it that's useful. I do not claim to be a fantastically experienced senior engineer. My background is different. I am a hacky scrappy founder producty kind of person. Definitely more of a generalist with a strong technical bent. But I know enough about coding and I know enough about project management to see that claude code is so much more than a coding tool. And we misunderstand it when we think about it just as a coding tool.",
