  "raw_transcript": "first up some housekeeping if you are interested in hearing from me on a 30-minute format all about Ai and strategy and how you build in an evolving landscape today is your last chance to sign up for a lightning lesson that I'm doing tomorrow on Maven I will put the link in the description next we're going to move to the big event for today in AI which is the Azure ignite conference they are going to be focused on agentic AI which is the big theme that we've seen over the past few months from major model Builders and they have a number of building blocks they're announcing ahead of time as a way to sort of queue up the audience I want to call out a few I may do a second followup on this when they actually do the whole conference and do all the announcements I'm sure they will save something they want to drop uh but the three that I want to call out that they announced ahead of time number one the AI agent service for your your personal life so this is one I I expect it will be their consumer Flagship launch more or less you can clone your personal voice I could clone my voice with uh azure's AI agent and at that point it can actually speak in my voice to someone who does not speak English in the language of their choice and it sounds like me speaking that language and so they're sort of pitching it as a consumer facing AI interpreter that doesn't just sound like you know Scarlet Johansson speaking but actually sounds like you speaking in that language so I could go to France I could go to Paris I could order a baguette and I could do so in my voice we'll see how that one goes uh I suspect there will be interesting bugs uh which brings me to number two uh they're actually doing a zerod day quest for AI bugs and perhaps having noticed some of the issues Google Gemini has had recently they are calling out an extra bug Bounty a doubled bug Bounty for any bugs that are found related to artificial intelligence so if you are someone who likes to hunt bugs this is a nice chance to double the bounty on any bugs that are found uh related to AI with Azure uh and finally they are announcing for developers uh a service that enables developers to build multi-agent workflows easily now I'm putting that last because it's probably the most powerful release longterm but it's also sort of the most table Stakes if you are a major model builder it's amazing how quickly things change we've gone from a world where we weren't even talking about agents seven or eight months ago to a world where major model Builders are just producing Frameworks and betas for multi-agent workflows all the time so Claude release computer use open AI has a framework for agents and of course now Microsoft is getting in on the game and making sure that you know they have a full Enterprise service for multi-agent as well we will see how that works in practice uh these sorts of things tend to get Road tested by developers fairly quickly but those are the three things I wanted to call out prior to the conference so AI agent service for developers the zero day quest for AI bugs sounds like it's a nice little Bounty they do not want embarrassing def sort of defects coming up in their in their Azure uh news cycles and then last but not least the personal interpreter agent which I think would be fun when I travel I would love to go to Japan and not sound absolutely horrific uh and maybe this is a way that I can do that probably not like I suspect I will still sound horrific in Japanese but one thing at a time all right cheers",
