  "raw_transcript": "If you're in the age of AI and you're building something, you want to build a side gig, think about your distribution first. What is your distribution advantage? What do you know that other people don't know about your market and where they hang out and what they like and what they don't like and what their pain points are? And are you a member of that community in such a way that they trust you and you're respected and you won't look like you're just scamming people if you talk about a product that you built? That is really really important.",

    "description": "What\u2019s really happening with building an AI-powered side gig?\nThe usual advice is super generic: \"AI makes building a side gig easier than ever\"\u2014sure. \n\nBut HOW? What's the actual advantage now? Why? How do YOU leverage that advantage to build an AI side gig that actually stands a chance of making money?\n\nIn this video, I share the inside scoop on launching an AI-native side gig that actually ships:\n\u2022 Why LLMs open a short-lived micro-niche window\u2014and how to spot it.\n\u2022 How to choose distribution-first micro markets you already know and serve.\n\u2022 What tool stack ships fast: Lovable.dev, Outseta, Framer, Gemini\u2014no heroics.\n\u2022 Where to draw the line: ruthless scope, square-deal pricing, real traction.\n\nFor solo builders, the window is real but short; choose a niche you know, keep scope tight, and let distribution\u2014not features\u2014decide.\n\nSubscribe for daily AI strategy and news.\nFor deeper playbooks and analysis: https://natesnewsletter.substack.com/",
