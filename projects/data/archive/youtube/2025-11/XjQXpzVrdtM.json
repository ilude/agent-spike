  "raw_transcript": "shed GPT is roaming the internet free to do what it wants except you get to tell it what to do that's right they released open AI operator which is again not the greatest name that is not their talent and that is okay it is a remarkable piece of technology it is in the openai Pro Plan so you are going to pay an arm and a leg for it uh $200 a month but I did get a chance to play with it and I want to tell you about it because it does feel like playing with the future because fundamentally these chat Bots have been locked away in the corner of our computer it's it's really weird to be in a world where you can tell chat GPT to basically go and do intelligent things on the internet and then you can disappear and go away and take a shower or you can go and do something else on your computer go for a run and it comes back and like it's still working away it's doing its thing now it's not perfect I had an instance where I was testing it on shopping so I went to my uh Amazon account it actually did a great job of turning away and closing its eyes metaphorically speaking so I could enter my password it told me it was no longer taking screenshots and I was in control and so I was able to enter my password and get into my Amazon account and then it started shopping and I told it I wanted of course more beanies so it goes and starts shopping for beanies The Taste is not super great I'm I'm going to have to work with it on like its taste in beanies but it it was able to add to cart it was able to say okay you don't want that one you want this one and adjust its preferences it sort of checked in with me the the problem came when it tried to make a clean cart for checkout and I didn't ask it to do that I am one of those people that uses that feature of just check out these one or two items and I leave a bunch of junk in the rest of my cart that I'm thinking about oh maybe I need that someday so I had like 40 something items in the cart and for chat GPT apparently things need to be neat and clean and so it added the beanies in and then was like I'm removing these other items from the cart and it was clearly like Nate you're a messy boy why are you leaving all these items in the cart and I was like oh gosh so it removed them and like this is one of those things where there's a reason it's called research preview it does check in with you about some things particularly Financial transactions which is great but sometimes it is genuinely an agent and it takes actions on your behalf and so it genuinely took actions on my behalf didn't check in with me and just emptied my card I was not happy I went in and I told it you got to you got to stop that like go back to your eror logs figure out what was in the card and put it back and I would say that was a partially successful conversation it did not have the ability apparently to go back to the error logs and identify the items it took out so that didn't work but it had made a reasonably intelligent decision in the first place it had just forgotten to communicate it which is very human uh it had decided to put them in save for later so they weren't Gone Forever they just got moved to save for later and it forgot to tell me it all worked out look it's not just for Amazon shopping it's actually for serious stuff you can use it for sales prospecting you can use it for competitive marketing intelligence you can use it for building portfol sites like you can go to operator and have operator work on the web for you on an AI building tool to build something it it's stacking intelligence into the web and so I think that even though it's called research preview even though it's really janky at times it's not perfect the fact that we have let chat GPT onto the internet is remarkable I I really feel like I'm living in the future and I will say the difference between this and Claude model context protocol is stunning number one it's really easy to get on board I literally go to the operator section of open Ai and I say I want to try operator and as long as I'm on a Pro Plan it says great here you are and I just start chatting and it's super seamless the browser is in the chat which I actually would have thought that's a terrible idea but intuitively it works it works really really well you can expand it in the chat and see a bigger window when you want you can take control whenever you want so you feel like you're watching but you're not out of control you can give it new instructions whenever you want it's a really good interface um and model context protocol from Claude like it was janky to set up very few people set it up and then it was not super Dependable browsing it was hard to see what the thing browsed and it we just come back it's this is so much better more people are going to use this and they I think that the difference in usability is going to mean that this is actually used for real work as opposed to just sort of as something that someone who is a developer could use for specific tasks and by the way I know developers do real work I know that developers and other people have used Cloud Model context protocol for important jobs I'm not saying that I'm saying by and large for the for the person who is using chat GPT more than any other model and there are hundreds of millions of them this is a breakthrough that will help them see that Chad gpg can browse the internet and nothing else will come close from an agent perspective this is probably the number one most used agent of 2025 that we're looking at all the other agents that people are going to build even if they're smarter for different jobs they're not going to be this used chat GPT has a consumer brand and if I tell people chat GPT can browse the internet now I get attention in a way AI agent hype doesn't get me attention if I say a AI agent to someone who's not a venture capitalist or who doesn't work in tech people are like what's that but if I say chat GPT can run around the internet and do work for you people pay attention and that's what they figured out and I think that's a pretty big deal so if you're in the Pro Plan definitely check it out if you're not I put up a whole substack on it with screenshots you can see all about it it's not just the Amazon thing I did a restaurant thing I did a travel thing I did researching for kids activities still getting to know it but there's a lot there and it's uh it's good to dive in so there you go that's open ai's operator",

Research Preview Limitations: While powerful, Operator occasionally makes autonomous decisions without user confirmation, showing room for improvement in communication and error handling.\n 5. Brand Power Matters: ChatGPT\u2019s strong consumer brand makes Operator more accessible and relatable, compared to complex tools like Claude\u2019s Model Context Protocol.\n 6. Pro Plan Accessibility: Available exclusively to ChatGPT Pro users, Operator costs $200/month, reflecting its advanced capabilities but limiting its reach to higher-end users.\n 7. Future of Productivity: The release of Operator signals a shift toward widespread adoption of agent-based workflows that can transform how we work and automate tasks in real-time.\n\nQuotes:\n\u201cWe\u2019re letting ChatGPT roam the internet, and it\u2019s like playing with the future.\u201d\n\u201cThe difference in usability means this isn\u2019t just a tool for developers\u2014it\u2019s for everyone who wants real work done.\u201d\n\u201cChatGPT\u2019s brand gives it an edge; saying it can browse the internet gets attention where \u2018AI agent\u2019 doesn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nSummary:\nOpenAI\u2019s Operator introduces a groundbreaking capability: letting ChatGPT act as an autonomous internet agent. From shopping on Amazon to conducting marketing research, this tool shows versatility and ease of use, embedded directly in the ChatGPT Pro interface. While Operator enables impressive autonomous workflows, occasional lapses in communication highlight it as a research preview. Compared to competitors like Claude\u2019s Model Context Protocol, Operator stands out for its accessibility and potential to revolutionize productivity. With a $200/month Pro plan requirement, it\u2019s a premium feature, but one poised to become a leading AI agent tool in 2025 and beyond.\n\nKeywords:\nOpenAI, ChatGPT, Operator, AI agent, internet browsing, automation, marketing intelligence, sales prospecting, workflow automation, Claude, Model Context Protocol, Amazon shopping, research preview, future of work, 2025 trends, usability, consumer AI, productivity tools, ChatGPT Pro, AI development, task automation, agent-based workflows, error handling, brand power, digital assistant",
