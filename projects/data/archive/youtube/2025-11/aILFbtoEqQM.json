  "raw_transcript": "Something like 90% of the Fortune 500 has copilot. 90%. That's why this is such an important video. That's why I've taken my time on it. It's got to be correct. Microsoft's own data though shows that most people aren't using the full capability set of Copilot. Now look, if you're not using the full capability set of Microsoft Word, which I know I don't, that's okay. It's Microsoft Word. It's there to help you type stuff. But if you're not using the full capability set of co-pilot, it's a big deal because co-pilot is literally intelligence on tap. And so if your workforce isn't using it, if your teams don't feel good about using it for things that are more than email, you're the ones missing out. Companies are literally paying for a Ferrari and they are driving it to the grocery store in first gear. That is what is going on with Copilot.",

Copilot Name Chaos: Microsoft slapped the Copilot brand on twelve different SKUs, so enterprises routinely buy the wrong license and stall adoption.\n 2. Underused Potential: Most teams limit Copilot to email drafts, ignoring high-value workflows like instant pivot tables, meeting-minute generation, and screenshot-based troubleshooting.\n 3. Workflow Mindset: Treat Copilot as \u201cintelligence on tap\u201d across entire processes\u2014prompt chains, cross-app report builds, and Vision-enabled data extraction reclaim hours.\n 4. Cultural Rollout: Small pilots, role champions, shared prompt libraries, and relentless measurement turn isolated wins into organization-wide productivity shifts.\n 5. ROI Stakes: Done right, Copilot saves roughly three hours per worker each week and can return twenty-fold on license spend.\n 6. Future Baseline: Within a year, advanced Copilot fluency will be table stakes; laggards will sacrifice competitive edge.\n\nQuotes\n\u201cCompanies are literally paying for a Ferrari and they are driving it to the grocery store in first gear.\u201d\n\u201cIf AI was as good as it needs to be to take our jobs, I wouldn\u2019t have to make this video.\u201d\n\u201cCopilot mastery is going to look like a basic requirement in about a year.\u201d\n\nSummary\nI spent months interviewing frontline users and dissecting case studies to learn why firms paying six-figure Copilot bills still use it only for drafting email. Microsoft stamped the Copilot name on twelve distinct SKUs, confusing leaders and burying huge gains. I decode each edition, reveal workflows from auto-generated pivot tables to cross-app prompt chains, and spotlight Vodafone\u2019s staged 68,000-seat rollout that recaptured three hours per worker weekly. The takeaway is cultural: pair phased experimentation, role-specific champions, ongoing measurement, transparent wins, and fearless prompt sharing to shift Copilot from novelty to indispensable enterprise leverage\u2014and secure twenty-fold returns on license spend.\n\nKeywords\nMicrosoft Copilot, Copilot SKUs, enterprise AI, workflow automation, prompt libraries, cultural change, Vodafone rollout, email productivity, Excel analysis, pivot tables, ROI",
