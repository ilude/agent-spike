  "raw_transcript": "so I got a few requests to do a post on ghost jobs what ghost jobs are what the labor market looks like for Tech and AI in 2025 I thought I would do it all in one video I want to talk about the trends that have changed that are shifting application and recruiting relationships I want to talk about how ghost jobs play into that and what they are and then I want to talk about what they aren't and how you can tell if something is a ghost job or not so first off major Trends the number one trend that I think is relevant for AI right now in jobs is that AI is disproportionately in favor of talent versus recruiting versus hiring side of the picture and the reason why is very simple it is easier and has far less liability issues to write an AI tool that enables you to be more effective at applying for jobs it's all upside it's all positive you can position it as a level or for people who might not be able to compete otherwise and there's no liability concerns there's no legal concerns at all on the other hand on the sell side or on the on the uh hiring side you need to be so careful about AI because you want to avoid bias in the hiring process there are legal implications for companies if there's even a hint of bias how can you prove that the AI system you're using is not biased and so companies that are in the space that are Reinventing how AI is and and recruiting work together they're moving slowly they're moving carefully the tools they're using are very pinpoint and they're doing that because of the legal risk involved and that is a dynamic that is shaping how AI shows up day-to-day in the talent market so for example there is no tool that allows you to out of box use AI to exclusive review all of these resum\u00e9s and then come back with an assessment now very large companies may choose to take that liability internally by writing their own tool that they don't talk about but there is no outof boox startup that does that because of the liability associated with AI making decisions in a blackbox manner that could reflect some kind of bias against a protected characteristic such as race and so so in that situation you have to be aware that your resume by and large is probably still going to have to be looked at by a human or not looked at at all at the same time resum\u00e9s are getting more and more consistent the distribution of resum\u00e9 quality used to be like a traditional bell curve where you'd have extraordinary r\u00e9sum\u00e9s that you could easily pick out you'd have really bad ones and you'd have a bunch in the middle it's now tightened up and moved to the right or whatever it looks like on your screen the other side and that means that all of these rums are bunched in quality because AI has enabled you to write a very consistent very uniform resume individually speaking that enables you to on average move up your individual resum\u00e9 quality unless you're a one or two% resum\u00e9 writer AI is probably going to improve you at this point if you're extraordinary it will make it worse but that's the edge case the problem is that too many people look at that and they see that it moves the quality up overall and they don't stop and think about the group effect they don't stop and think about the fact that there's groups of resum\u00e9s that now look very similar sitting in recruiter inboxes and recruiters don't have the time to parse the minute differences they're giving your resume less than 10 seconds of attention and you have to grab them and so that means that resum\u00e9s that stand out are hybrid resum\u00e9s that stand out have the AI component that levels up the quality but they have the specificity that you only get from being a human that deeply understands the role and there's really no substitute for that if you want to grab recruiter attention in 10 seconds how does all of this relate to ghost jobs I started this talking about ghost jobs here we are four minutes in so ghost jobs happen for three reasons number one the company forgets their hiring for the role and the role has drifted internally in the company company and it's actually not that original role that they're leaving up that is an accident that is a mistake it is a ghost job but it's not an intentional ghost job and eventually it gets cleaned up and the poor recruiter has to go back through the pile of resumes and say do any of these fit the pivot that we just made on this role or not that's a lot of work number two is the company is intentionally fooling you that the rarest case but it does happen the company is trying to position itself in the market as hiring in order to impress investors or somebody else they create a fake job listing they may advertise it for fake on LinkedIn and it does happen it does not happen super often and the reason why it doesn't happen super often is really simple it's expensive it's not free to do that like you have to actually put time into writing it you have to put time into advertising it you have to make sure that it's posted in a way that people can see it because the whole point of a ghost job in that situation is to show that you're hiring so if you can't show it if you can't advertise it if you don't put in the work to notify people of its existence you're not getting the value for your deception and I realize that sounds very mocky of alant of me but that's just rational right that that's that's how that works um and then the last one is actually more common than the sort of intentional deception one and that is that companies post real roles these actually aren't roles that have drifted but those real roles they are only going to hire Superstars for and so they're extraordinarily selective and they're willing to be very very patient I think that Talent sometimes assumes if a job is posted you want the role filled ASAP that's not always true the role may be a real role that you are willing to wait six months to fill for the right perfect candidate and talent doesn't always see it that way so those are all reasons why a job can be perceived as a ghost job now I want to get into how can you tell if a ghost job is a ghost job because there are signs if you are looking at the rare situation where the ghost job is intentionally created you can tell because it tends to not have the diversity of posting that you get with real jobs so A diversity of posting means different levels different job families if you look at the job page overall there's a nice mix there if you compare it to the public statements of the company it align so you can see they're investing in an area they're hiring in the area that lines up hiring managers will talk about real jobs in a way they won't about ghost jobs the writing quality itself on the job is better it's not a vanilla job posting it has some specifics to it so there's a lot of quiet signals when you're looking at actual deception that you can read for when you're looking at other things like the company taking its time or job drift one of the signals is just just the age of the job if the job has been there a long time and is still up it sort of by itself a yellow flag that the company's priorities may have changed or the company may just be EXT extremely choosy you can usually tell which it is by looking at recruiter postings because recruiters will say pretty bluntly we're still hiring for this role this is the specific flavor of candidate we want if you know someone say something like they they'll use LinkedIn for that so how does this all tie together AI ghost jobs what what is the relation ship well fundamentally recruiters have limited time AI is eating their time with huge application volume searches and that tight distribution of application quality and that means they have less time to actively manage their listings and I think that when you look at the causes for this ghost job perception a lot of the time it's comes down to the recruiters not being able to be on top of the listings as you want because they feel understaffed and that's one of those things where we've never really come back from 2020 recruit ERS remain under staffed and under pressure in a way that we just didn't have during the 2010s and so if you're trying to stand out in this market it is more empowering to think of it as probably not a deceptive job it's probably if you get a rejection almost certainly someone looked at your resume and decided it wasn't a fit and so you should think about it that way you should regard it that way and then you should ask yourself well did I apply for a job that was actually a good fit is my resume a fantastic fit is my resume both like AI quality Baseline but also showing some human flare that lets me stand out these are things you can do and change these are it's actually empowering to think about it this way versus just saying oh it's a ghost job that's why I got rejected now that may be comforting to your ego but one I don't think it's realistic in like 95 98% of cases and two I don't think it's useful to you it doesn't help you get better in this market so this a bit of a longer YouTube post than I usually do but I wanted to really dive into this because I got a couple of comments in in the YouTube video I posted a couple days ago about Salesforce and I wanted to just go in on ghost jobs and say let's have an honest conversation so put your thoughts under the comments and let's see where we get cheers",

    "description": "My site: https://natebjones.com/\nMy links: https://linktr.ee/natebjones\nMy substack: https://natesnewsletter.substack.com/\n\nTakeaways:\n 1. AI\u2019s Impact on Job Applications: AI has leveled up resume quality, creating a tighter distribution of highly polished applications, but recruiters now struggle to differentiate candidates.\n 2. Ghost Job Causes: Ghost jobs result from forgotten postings, rare intentional deception to impress investors, or real roles where companies are waiting for a superstar hire.\n 3. Spotting Real Jobs: Authentic job postings align with company goals, span various seniority levels and job families, and feature well-written, specific descriptions.\n 4. Recruiter Limitations: Recruiters remain understaffed post-2020, leading to limited time for managing listings and parsing through high application volumes.\n 5. AI-Enhanced Resumes Need Human Flair: While AI can improve baseline resume quality, specificity and deep role understanding are necessary to stand out and grab a recruiter\u2019s attention in under 10 seconds.\n 6. Legal Barriers to AI in Hiring: Companies are cautious with AI in recruitment due to potential bias risks, slowing the adoption of AI tools in hiring decisions.\n 7. Rejection Isn\u2019t a Ghost Job Indicator: Most resumes are reviewed before rejection, empowering candidates to tailor applications strategically rather than assuming roles are fake.\n\nQuotes:\n\u201cWe\u2019ve never really come back from 2020\u2014recruiters remain understaffed and under pressure.\u201d\n\u201cAI has moved resume quality to the right, creating uniformity, but only human specificity can stand out.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s empowering to think of rejection as a signal to improve, rather than assuming a ghost job was to blame.\u201d\n\nSummary:\nAI has reshaped job applications by improving resume quality but created challenges for recruiters due to higher application volumes and uniformity. Ghost jobs result from forgotten postings, rare deceptions, or selective hiring for superstars. Spotting real jobs involves checking for alignment with company goals and diverse, well-written postings. Legal risks slow AI adoption in hiring, so most resumes are still reviewed manually. Rejection usually reflects recruiter evaluation, empowering candidates to refine their approach. In this dynamic landscape, blending AI\u2019s strengths with human specificity is key to standing out.\n\nKeywords:\nAI, ghost jobs, resumes, recruiting, hiring, job market, 2025, legal risks, AI tools, recruiter challenges, job applications, job postings, resume quality, human specificity, rejection, talent acquisition",
