  "raw_transcript": "Steve Jobs built a priesthood for computing and that priesthood is becoming irrelevant in the age of AI. That's my central thesis. I want to introduce to you the idea that Steve Jobs's entire vision for Apple was something that was uniquely suited to driving rapid adoption of computing by the world. And that the attributes that made Apple successful, the DNA that Steve Jobs inculcated into Apple that is alive and well under Tim Cook, it doesn't work in the age of AI. In fact, it's counterproductive in the age of AI. And I'm going to explain why. And this matters because this is one of the most valuable companies in the world. A lot of people's retirements accounts, the entire stock market, Apple is so big, it's almost too big to fail. If Apple doesn't get AI right, all of us will feel the difference. And I want to explain why Apple's at risk of doing that despite the recent news that they are competing heavily in the AI space. I'm aware of it. I've read it. We'll get into it. Here is why they are almost inevitably programmed not to win. Culture is so powerful as a shaping force for companies. It is part of why Apple is struggling. Let's dive into why. First, what worked about Apple back in the '9s? Steve Jobs had a central insight. He believed that part of what made computers complicated for people was that they were uncontrolled. They were a nerdy, techy, configurable, complicated experience. He believed controlling the entire experience of computing would liberate users from complexity. Apple's designers would perfect everything in secret. They would ship polished products that users didn't know they needed, but they were so beautiful. They were so simple to use. They solved problems so perfectly that everyone would immediately want one. I am old enough to remember when a lot of the Apple products first came out, including the ones that are in the museums now. Yes, there are Apple products in museums. They have all had that aspect under Steve Jobs. And frankly, Tim Cook has tried to continue that with the Apple Watch and more recently with the Vision Pro. polished products, what users don't know they need, perfected endlessly in secret until every aspect shines like a jewel. Now, you can rightfully complain that it hasn't been the same since Steve left. I think that's kind of reasonable. Steve was one of the most prolific inventors that we have ever seen. And so, it would be a hard act to follow. And I think Tim knows that. But the DNA that Steve left the company, what I've described remains true. Apple obsesses over perfecting experiences in secret. The good engineers at Apple never ever leave. So, how does that work in the age of AI? What about the age of AI doesn't connect with Apple's culture? I'm going to give you a few, but I bet you can think of some of them as well. I bet this is not too surprising. Number one, the age of AI is a messy age. This is not a world where you can be deterministic and polished. Inherently with token architectures you have probabilistic system behavior. You have an unpredictability in the response. You cannot nail it down so it is perfect every time. One of the things I like to emphasize with quality assurance with QA is that we are in the midst of a profound shift where before most of QA energy was around polishing software before it launched very Applelike. Now, most of QA energy is around making sure that we can sustain the quality of software in production. Or at least it should be. We're not there yet, but I think that's where it's going. Why? Because production software is living now. It's messy. It's complicated. Look no further than the release of Chat GPT5. Let me ask you a very simple question. Would Apple have ever let that out the door? Would Apple have ever let that kind of chart mishap happen on a live stream? Would Apple have ever let out a product that immediately had to be kind of halfway rolled back and had the old product renewed and had obvious server outages in the first day. No, Apple would never have done that, but OpenAI did. And OpenAI in just a decade has gone to become a $300 billion company. Now, granted, that's not as valuable as Apple yet, but the point is the trajectory. The point is that the fundamental incentives and levers that Steve correctly identified in the age of computing do not set Apple up with the culture to compete in the age of AI. Users in the age of computers found computers not obviously useful. They were nerdy. They were complicated. You didn't obviously need them. I know for folks who are younger listening and watching this, that seems insane. I recognize that my kids feel the same way, but it was true. I remember growing up when nobody had a computer except a couple of nerds and it wasn't considered necessary. I remember when people gradually decided that computers were necessary and Best Buy became a big thing. I remember the same transition with cell phones. Apple was able to leverage both of those big transitions, the transition to the PC and the transition to the cell phone, because both of them needed Apple polish and perfection to become obviously desirable status symbols that solved problems in ways that were so simple and obvious anyone could do it. It's not just that the iPhone has become a status symbol. Arguably, it's less of a status symbol because it's so ubiquitous now. it's that it solves problems by creating a walled garden and a polished experience. In a messy AI world, you can't do that. And I will go farther. I will say the reason the messy AI world is working well and gaining adoption and the reason that LLMs as a whole have gone to a billion users already in just two or three years, much faster than the adoption of the iPhone, is because unlike with computers, AI is obviously useful. AI is not hm I wonder if it's interesting or useful. It is a generalpurpose technology that is incredibly and obviously useful and people don't have to wonder. And it's incredibly and obviously useful to an eighth of the world's population. Now, now we don't all use it the same way. Some of us use it with really fancy prompts and agents and automation workflows. Some of us use it to tell our kids bedtime stories. Some of it use it some of us use it as an AI girlfriend. Some of us use it for just chatting about the day and coming up with recipes. We have a wide range of uses which makes sense if it's a general purpose technology. But the point is that it's useful in a way that is clear and clean enough on the surface and that is immediately validating enough that we don't have to have a perfect interface or perfect product to make it work. I would argue with you and I actually I don't know that you'd argue back. The chatbot is not a perfect product. I've had the head of chat GPT in an interview say so. It's what took off. It's what went viral. It's not particularly a great interface, but the value of the intelligence was so incredibly high it didn't matter. That all of that is contra the DNA of Apple. Apple was built for a world where the the obvious value wasn't obvious. Where the value of computing was hard and they had to make it make it possible, make it visible. Not anymore. Not anymore. The value is right there. And Apple doesn't know what to do with that. And that is why we see the news that Apple is going back to the well. They're going back to Steve Jobs. They're going back to their DNA and they are building a device. That's what Apple does. They do hardware. They build devices. They're going to build a tabletop device, right? It's going to be an AI device in 2027. Do you know how fast AI is going? You've got to if you listen to this this podcast, right? Like like you you all know like it's incredibly fast. We may be at chat GPT7 by the time this device comes out. OpenAI will have had time to work with Joonyi Iive and come out with their own hardware device. They will not be blocked by the same obsessive DNA. They will be able to release. And so what Apple is doing is cultivating an old habit and failing to recognize that the world has changed around them. They are having trouble attracting AI talent because the world has changed around them. The world is okay with messiness now because the utility is obvious. The world is okay with an open ecosystem with competitive AI models with using multiple models at once. Apple was built for a world where you picked your computer and you stuck with it. It was Windows versus Mac. I got to tell you, I use Open AI and I use Claude and I use Gemini and I will use Grock. I use a lot of different models. I'm not loyal to one. And you know, for a lot of people, chat GPT is the default. I don't want to gloss that over. But just because it's the default doesn't mean it's impossible to use other things and doesn't mean that a substantial portion of power users aren't using a bunch of different models. We live in a multimodel world. And in particular, the models are close to parody and it's become very obvious that the future is going to be multimodel. Apple's not built for a world where that technology is so ubiquitous and spreads. so easily that we can have phenomenal open- source models and there just is no point in having a walled garden LLM. It just it doesn't work well. It's not going to sustain, especially given Apple's obsession with polish and release cadence. Siri is still terrible and Apple's on this very long time horizon to make Siri better. And it won't matter because everyone is transitioning to talking with chat GPT in the meantime. The voice experience is moving on without Apple. And Apple just cannot get past the obsession with perfection that worked in the age of computing. That is the core insight that Tim needs to shift to move Apple forward. And I care. I like Apple. Look, I'm recording this on a Mac. I have an iPhone. I think that Apple's simplification vision has been powerful for computing. And frankly, a lot of the development work that is building the age of AI is happening through engineers who prefer to work on Mac. Mac still has a place in the hearts of many people working on the AI revolution. But because of this perfection with polish and perfection, because of this obsession with getting it right, we have a situation where Apple is at risk of becoming the wallpaper. Apple is at risk of becoming IBM, Windows, the very thing Steve Jobs didn't want to see happen to his company. Apple is going to become irrelevant. Not necessarily unprofitable, not necessarily tiny, but largely irrelevant from a value perspective because value is moving from do you have an incredible computer that helps you do things to do you have the intelligence at your fingertips to get where you want to go? And for some people that's the recipes and for some people that's building code. And you'll come up with your own uses. And there will be a whole portfolio of trillion dollar companies built off of that idea. But Apple is not setting itself up to be one of those trillion dollar AI companies. They're setting themselves up to be the wallpaper in the AI revolution. And the more their plans leak, the more it reinforces that they have not made the cultural change that they need to. Apple intelligence remains in limited beta. They just they they cannot get past the polish piece and they're not going to because large language models are imperfect and the labs recognize that and they're public about how they're fixing it and public about how they're addressing it and they release quickly and they iterate. That is the future in the age of intelligence and Apple is just constitutionally unable to adjust to that. I hope it changes. I have seen cultural change at companies, but a culture change this big at a company this influential, we have not seen that. If Apple really changes and embraces an AI first mindset, that's a big deal. That's a really, really big deal. So, this is my love letter to Apple. This is my appeal to the priesthood of computing. Please recognize that the world has changed. recognize that the the obsession with detail, the obsession with perfection, the quality of computing and simple solutions, the things that got you adoption and love for the Mac and for the iPhone, those are not things that work in the same way. Now, we have a technology that everyone is adopting even though it's messy. You will not win by waiting years to polish it. You have got to ship. You've got to ship. And I know that's not the same way Steve Jobs taught the company, but you've got to ship. Otherwise, you're you're going to risk leaving yourself behind the most important revolution we've seen in our lifetimes. Otherwise, you're going to miss the biggest general purpose technology wave that we're going to see. And that's what Apple's looking like they're doing right now. I hope it changes, but everything I see out of Apple suggests that it's not. And that's why it's it's built into the DNA. Well, best of luck. I'll keep using my iPhone in the meantime.",
