  "raw_transcript": "Five things that I think you can take with you and that I think are unlikely to be disrupted by AI given where jagged intelligence is going. Number one is taste. Knowing how to solve a problem matters. Choosing the right thing from the million options AI gives you matters. Understanding what not to build matters. Taste matters. Extreme agency is number two. The ability to operate with minimal direction. Maximize ownership. If AI is good at execution, humans must get good at goal setting. We must get good at defining priorities, course correcting, building systems. Agency is going to be highly valued. Number three is learning velocity. This one does not get talked about as much. It's not about knowledge accumulation. It's about speed of adaptation. If the half-life of a technical skill is being compressed farther and farther, then the value is going to acrue to those who can learn faster than knowledge inflates, who can surf the wave of obsolescence instead of just drowning in it. That's what matters.",

Knowledge Hyperinflation Curve: AI has pushed Buckminster Fuller\u2019s knowledge-doubling rate from decades to months, flooding us with information faster than anyone can absorb.\n 2. College Credential Collapse: Degrees feel like empty rituals because AI can supply (or fake) the same knowledge on demand.\n 3. R\u00e9sum\u00e9 Obsolescence: Monster.com\u2019s bankruptcy signals that traditional job-application signals no longer prove real competence in an AI era.\n 4. Judgment Over Knowledge: We\u2019re shifting from a \u201cknowledge economy\u201d to a \u201cjudgment economy\u201d where discernment and context beat facts alone.\n 5. Five Human Moats: Taste, extreme agency, learning velocity, long intent horizons, and interruptibility are traits AI still struggles to mimic.\n 6. Action Plan: Stop chasing credentials; build proof-of-work projects that show judgment and resilience machines can\u2019t imitate.\n\nQuotes:\n\u201cWe live in a hyper-inflating knowledge economy\u2014no one can read it all.\u201d\n\u201cThe r\u00e9sum\u00e9 is now a chatbot prompt away from perfect, which makes it worthless.\u201d\n\u201cThe future pays for judgment, not just knowledge.\u201d\n\nSummary:\nIn this video I break down why our knowledge-based economy is cracking under AI\u2019s super-charged learning curve. College degrees and r\u00e9sum\u00e9s lose value when language models can fake them in seconds. I trace the knowledge-doubling curve, explain Monster\u2019s bankruptcy as a warning, and show why simply collecting skills no longer works. Instead, I argue for a \u201cjudgment economy\u201d built on five human advantages\u2014taste, extreme agency, learning velocity, long intent horizons, and interruptibility. I invite you to spot other AI weak points and start cultivating proof-of-work that machines can\u2019t copy. Together we\u2019ll navigate this shift and keep our work unmistakably human.\n\nKeywords:\nAI, knowledge economy, knowledge hyperinflation, Buckminster Fuller, knowledge doubling curve, college degrees, r\u00e9sum\u00e9 collapse, Monster bankruptcy, job market, judgment economy, taste, extreme agency, learning velocity, intent horizon, interruptibility, future of work",
