  "raw_transcript": "Five things that I think you can take with you and that I think are unlikely to be disrupted by AI given where jagged intelligence is going. Number one is taste. Knowing how to solve a problem matters. Choosing the right thing from the million options AI gives you matters. Understanding what not to build matters. Taste matters. Extreme agency is number two. The ability to operate with minimal direction. Maximize ownership. If AI is good at execution, humans must get good at goal setting. We must get good at defining priorities, course correcting, building systems. Agency is going to be highly valued. Number three is learning velocity. This one does not get talked about as much. It's not about knowledge accumulation. It's about speed of adaptation. If the half-life of a technical skill is being compressed farther and farther, then the value is going to acrue to those who can learn faster than knowledge inflates, who can surf the wave of obsolescence instead of just drowning in it. That's what matters.",
