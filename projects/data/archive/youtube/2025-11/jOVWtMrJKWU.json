  "raw_transcript": "Dario amade the founder of anthropic gave an interview yesterday saying he believes super intelligence not just general intelligence like human level but super intelligence where it does like the work of an organization or it's a country of geniuses in a building as Dario likes to say that's apparently coming by 2027 I guess that's roughly in line with Stargate and like the 10 million gpus or whatever they're going to put in Texas by the way if you wonder like how they're going to power it someone did an energy analysis and they don't it doesn't look like there's enough time to build enough nuclear to power it so it will given that it's in Texas probably an if if I I were to guess be a solar array and that was sort of the the conclusion of the analysis is that you could power it with about a 7 Mile by Seven Mile solar array I don't know if that's true because we don't really know the compute requirements and the energy requirements for the gpus because they don't exist yet so this is all very theoretical I would I would put it a guate but the idea is that you have you could have a solar array that could power this thing so if you've been wondering where will they get the power it might be solar we'll see they're not saying that's an aside we come back to Dario we come back to the 2027 Singularity it's like the model makers are competing with each other to say super intelligence is coming because the head of product at open AI came back and said well I think Super intelligence might come sooner than that maybe 2026 okay fine fine but nobody else in society is really thinking about that like when R1 hit hit the the servers and everyone could get it and it was it was a thinking model at 3% of the cost of 01 and it was very close to 01 in performance by the way it is a deeply weird model I don't know if you've played with it but that is a model that has its own opinions it is certainly not just a copy of an open AI model as some people are saying it's a strange one and if you if you play with it you get the sense that they have figured out thinking but they've done a different architecture which from their paper it does look like they have like some very interesting architectural decisions designed to keep things efficient so the point is these massive developments are happening all the time and model makers who are the closest to these models are saying massive intelligence is coming like we are not slowing down and newspapers are not really talking about this as a foundationally transformative technology they're they're just not they they mentioned Stargate as if it's an infrastructure project but if it if it does work it's going to change the way the world works and we should probably at least report the possibility that it might work and if it doesn't work a project like deep seek might do that so I don't know what to say except that I think that we haven't done a a good job as a society talking about this and I think nobody is incentivized to talk about it the model makers are incentivized to build models they are in a race with each other and their eyes are on every other model maker at the table it's like a poker player looking only at the table but everybody else around is affected by this poker game It Matters by the way if you're wondering what's the latest in the poker game anthropic doesn't just get investments from AWS now Google put another billion dollars into anthropic this brings Google's total investment to3 billion doll and it is starting to solidify a partnership of players outside Stargate who are interested in AI Google was outside Stargate AWS was outside Stargate anthropic was outside Stargate I thought that when they announced Stargate there would be a rejigging of players in the space from from the competition that emerged when other players realized they were cut out of that immense amount of gpus and that's exactly what happened that same night apparently Google threw another billion dollars at anthropic so nothing exists in a vacuum if you decide to Crown a winner like open Ai and put 500 billion dollars into that winner other players are going to respond and it is not clear that money wins this race I think that's something deep seek has shown us it's a very interesting time so there you go news a little commentary it is a wild one model makers are talking about super intelligence and most of the rest of the world is saying that this is just autocomplete at some point this is going to have to collapse into an actual shared reality because AI isn't stopping",

    "description": "My site: https://natebjones.com/\nMy links: https://linktr.ee/natebjones\nMy substack: https://natesnewsletter.substack.com/\nGoogle investment: https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/01/google-increases-investment-in-anthropic-by-another-1-billion/\nAnthropic 2027: https://cybernews.com/news/anthropics-ceo-ai-surpassing-humans/\nOpenAI VP Product: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge-rN5tDaC8\n\nTakeaways:\n 1. Superintelligence by 2027: Dario Amodei of Anthropic predicts superintelligence\u2014akin to a country of geniuses\u2014could emerge by 2027, accelerating transformative possibilities.\n 2. Energy for Stargate: A seven-mile-by-seven-mile solar array might power the 10 million GPUs planned for Stargate, highlighting renewable energy challenges and opportunities.\n 3. Google\u2019s Billion-Dollar Move: Google invested an additional $1 billion into Anthropic, signaling a solidifying partnership and competition with Stargate\u2019s backing of OpenAI.\n 4. DeepSeek\u2019s Architectural Innovation: DeepSeek demonstrates that architectural breakthroughs, not just funding, could shape the future of AI models.\n 5. Public Awareness Gap: While insiders race toward superintelligence, the general public largely underestimates its transformative potential, dismissing it as \u201cautocomplete.\u201d\n 6. Global Implications of AI Poker: Major players like Google, Anthropic, and AWS are reacting to Stargate\u2019s massive resource allocation, reshaping alliances and AI strategies.\n 7. A Fragmented Reality: The AI race is unfolding at breakneck speed, but society and media lag in acknowledging its foundational impact on global systems.\n\nQuotes:\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t done a good job as a society talking about this, and nobody is incentivized to.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a poker player looking only at the table, but everybody else around is affected by this poker game.\u201d\n\u201cAt some point, this is going to have to collapse into an actual shared reality, because AI isn\u2019t stopping.\u201d\n\nSummary:\nThe AI world is moving rapidly toward superintelligence, with insiders like Dario Amodei predicting transformative systems by 2027. Projects like Stargate and DeepSeek are at the forefront, raising questions about compute power, energy sustainability, and architectural innovation. Meanwhile, competition is intensifying as Google invests heavily in Anthropic to rival Stargate\u2019s dominance. Despite these developments, public awareness and media coverage remain disconnected, often reducing AI advancements to \u201cautocomplete.\u201d As the stakes grow, this fragmented understanding must converge with the reality of AI\u2019s foundational impact on society.\n\nKeywords:\nsuperintelligence, Anthropic, Dario Amodei, Stargate, GPUs, solar energy, Google investment, DeepSeek, AI competition, OpenAI, AWS, media disconnect, transformative AI, architectural innovation, renewable energy, AI alliances, foundational technology",
