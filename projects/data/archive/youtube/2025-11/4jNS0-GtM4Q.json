  "raw_transcript": "We talk a lot about AI automating AI picking up work from us. But I've been thinking a lot about this idea that the most valuable AI is the AI that helps you to see clearly when you as a good human in your domain with deep experience needs to touch the work. And this model more than chat GPT5 more than Opus 4.1 it's clear enough in its narrative that you can see really clearly what it's trying to go for. and you can see really clearly where you need to touch the work to make it better. And so if you think about it within the context of a larger say deck preparation workflow, a spreadsheet model preparation workflow, this model is going to speed the time it takes to get these important pieces of work Done.",
