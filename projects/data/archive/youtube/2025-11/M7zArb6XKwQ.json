  "raw_transcript": "Another thing that I think people overlook is that they don't think about their brands as entities. They don't think about aligning their brands into a single entity. And I'll explain what I mean by that. You want to audit your top 20 brand mention using Google's natural language API. You want to create a single source of truth description document for your brand. You need to send update requests to any site with an outdated description because your goal is to give a single brand entity statement consistent representation across the web so it maximizes the odds you'll appear in something like a Google summary in the correct way. And focus on the five highest authority sites mentioning you. This is not new either. Obviously, you focus on high authority sites. The the key is to make sure the exact same roughly 50word company description or brand description is everywhere because again you are implanting that into the LLM's parameters.",

    "description": "My site: https://natebjones.com\nMy substack: https://natesnewsletter.substack.com/\nMy story: https://open.substack.com/pub/natesnewsletter/p/beyond-seo-winning-visibility-in?r=1z4sm5&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&showWelcomeOnShare=true\n\nTakeaways:\n 1. Google AI Steals Clicks: Answer boxes generated by Google\u2019s own models now swallow roughly 15 percent of clicks, shifting value from links to instant summaries.\n 2. High-Intent ChatGPT Traffic: ChatGPT owns just 1\u20132 percent of search volume, yet its users sit deep in the purchase funnel and are worth targeting.\n 3. Brand as LLM Parameter: Reduce your positioning to a single five-to-eight-word phrase and repeat it verbatim in schema, PR boilerplates, and partner directories so models embed it as an entity.\n 4. Entity Hygiene and Testing: Enforce one 50-word description across top-authority sites, then run monthly \u201clist and delete\u201d tests to confirm that major models recall you correctly.\n 5. Machine-Readable PR Sheets: Host a public JSON cheat sheet with canonical differentiators; structured data delivers facts that models trust and quote verbatim.\n 6. Widgets Beat Summaries: Interactive calculators or diagnostic tools that require user input cannot be replicated by an LLM summary, forcing the human click that drives leads.\n 7. Edge Speed and Licensing: Serve sub-50 ms JSON endpoints for bots and use robots.txt to grant crawl rights in exchange for attribution, then monitor share-of-voice dashboards.\n\nQuotes:\n\u201cYour brand is no longer a webpage\u2014it\u2019s a parameter inside an LLM.\u201d\n\u201cStructured JSON outperforms prose because machines favor facts they can\u2019t misread.\u201d\n\u201cInteractive widgets create a moat; an AI summary can\u2019t replicate a real-time personalized tool.\u201d\n\nSummary:\nI explain why 15 percent of Google clicks vanished: Google\u2019s own AI summaries now answer simple queries, not ChatGPT. That shift demands an AI-first content architecture. Your brand must live inside language models as a consistent five-to-eight-word parameter echoed in schema, PR boilerplates, and high-authority listings. Build FAQ-style pages and coin branded methods to seed models, publish machine-readable JSON cheat sheets, and police attribution via robots.txt. Drive human clicks with interactive widgets and serve lightning-fast edge endpoints for real-time crawl. Finally, automate dashboards that audit brand share of voice across AI platforms and iterate on results.\n\nKeywords:\nGoogle AI summaries, click-through decline, ChatGPT traffic, AI-first content architecture, brand parameter, schema markup, entity alignment, FAQ strategy, machine-readable JSON, interactive widgets, edge computing, robots.txt license, share of voice dashboards, LLM readers, high-intent search",
