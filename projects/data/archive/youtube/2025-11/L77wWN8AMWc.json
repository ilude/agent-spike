  "raw_transcript": "You can set up claude with multiple agents to do that in claude code for example. What is the E? Execution. Execution environment. Is it cloud contained? So it runs on the provider sandbox. Chad GPT claude both do that in their application interfaces. Is it integrated into your IDE? So it works within the development environment inside cursor for example. Is it platform hosted with dedicated agent runtime? Naden can be that. It doesn't have to be that depending on how you configure it. Is it infrastructure spanning? Can it deploy or access different external systems and use complex tools? Manis can do that. You can configure cloud code to do that as well. And so I when you look across this, it's easy for you to say, well Nate, you just said a bunch of things, right? You said it needs to have complexity def defined execution environment defined autonomy defined the modality defined",
