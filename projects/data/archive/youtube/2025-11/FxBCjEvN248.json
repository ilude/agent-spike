It's actually not the risk. It's a little bit of the equity and the upside. Let's not kid ourselves. But it's the passion for the problem space. That is what distinguishes people who stay in startups. That is what distinguishes people who stay in tech. They are passionate about solving a particular problem with technical leverage. And if you don't have that, it doesn't matter if you're an engineer, like you have to be passionate about the problem space. If you don't have that passion, it is going to be difficult for you to stand out. And I've seen over and over again, if you do have that passion, you find a way in a door by hook or by crook.",

    "description": "My site: https://natebjones.com\nMy substack: https://natesnewsletter.substack.com/\nThe story: https://open.substack.com/pub/natesnewsletter/p/how-to-get-an-ai-job-in-2025-beyond?r=1z4sm5&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&showWelcomeOnShare=true\n\nTakeaways:\n 1. Big-Tech Valuations Are Topped Out: OpenAI, Anthropic, Microsoft, and other giants already trade at sky-high multiples, so new hires get limited equity growth.\n 2. Risk-Reward Has Skewed: You still absorb startup-level risk at these companies, but the potential payoff no longer justifies it.\n 3. Series A Sweet Spot: Earlier-stage AI startups offer real multiple expansion, meaning your equity can still compound meaningfully.\n 4. Start With Targeting, Not R\u00e9sum\u00e9s: The first strategic move is picking undervalued, mission-aligned startups\u2014polishing application materials comes later.\n 5. Follow-Me Capital Is a Red Flag: When investors pile into late rounds, it signals most upside is already captured; employees feel that same compression.\n 6. Equity Beats Salary for Wealth Creation: A high cash offer can\u2019t rival the life-changing impact of meaningful equity in a breakout startup, so weigh offers accordingly.\n\nQuotes:\n\u201cYour goal isn\u2019t to land at OpenAI\u2014it\u2019s to discover the next OpenAI before everyone else does.\u201d\n\u201cIf the round is already too juicy, the upside is already gone.\u201d\n\u201cThe risk is still real, but the reward shrinks when valuations soar\u2014pick companies where both remain in balance.\u201d\n\nSummary:\nI begin by reframing the AI job hunt: skip the giants and chase the rise. OpenAI, Anthropic, Microsoft, and peers have soaked up vast capital, pushing valuations sky-high. That means the traditional startup deal\u2014risk traded for life-changing equity\u2014no longer holds; doubling or tripling shares isn\u2019t worth the risk when downside is real. Instead, target Series-A-level startups where upside is uncapped and impact tangible. Starting with company targeting, not r\u00e9sum\u00e9 tweaks, is the forgotten first move. By reading market multiples and aligning risk with reward, we maximize both career growth and financial upside. This mindset resets the playing field for ambitious builders.\n\nKeywords:\nAI job search, startup targeting, Series A, equity upside, risk-reward, big-tech valuations, OpenAI, Anthropic, Microsoft, career strategy",
