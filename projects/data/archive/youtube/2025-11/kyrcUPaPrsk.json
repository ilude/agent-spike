  "raw_transcript": "We have a supply explosion of AI content and it is an AI slop issue across every business I talk to. Every single one, they're like, \"What do we do with AI slop?\" We have product managers producing PRDs that are not good. We have marketers who are producing marketing copy and it's not good. But we managers or frankly any individual who wants to know they're actually writing well with AI, we don't know what to do. How do we know that what we're shipping is good quality? It's not about did the AI help. We're past that point. The AI is helping. It is about is the quality output good and we humans don't have the time to assess all of it because AI is so good at producing it. So we are in a world now where marketers have gone from can I write a blog post today to I could stamp out 50 and now you have to ask yourself can I assess the 50 that have been produced? Are they actually good? Are they brand aligned? Is the content right? Etc. And you know what people are doing for that? They're using their eyes or they're skipping it because there hasn't really been a good quality gate.",
