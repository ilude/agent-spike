  "raw_transcript": "So, is Sam right? Are we in a bubble? I would actually argue that if he means, are there elements of unfounded hype in AI? Yes, there are. Absolutely. Is there froth? Yes. As a wonderful example, again, just from this week, I could pick any number of a dozen examples. But look at the number of lovable copycats out there. How many companies do you know who have put up a little box saying, \"What do you want to build today?\" The latest one is Air Table. I would not I would not think that Air Table should be doing that, but they've decided to. With any gold rush, you get people rushing in to stake a claim where they think there's gold. And Lovable has demonstrated there's gold in vibe coding. And so now there's a rush there, right? And there's going to be a lot of me too players. Anytime you have value, you have me too players. That doesn't mean it's inherently a bubble no matter what. And I think that people sort of overindexed on that comment and they thought, \"Oh, there's hype players. That means it's a bubble.",
