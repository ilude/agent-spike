  "raw_transcript": "so Jensen hang did a keynote at Nvidia last night and I had to sort through it it was so much I want to go through briefly the top three things that I think matter and I want to tell you why I think they reinforce nvidia's value proposition why it made sense for Jensen to announce them the first is on the consumer side the GeForce RTX 5000 series is a new GPU it's built on the Blackwell architecture which is what they use for AI here's why that matters they've always built gpus they were always going to play in the gaming space and what this does is it reinforces their stickiness as a gaming platform in a way they've never been able to do before before it would run on a Nvidia GPU sure the game runs it's great and you move on but any other GPU could also run that game but with Blackwell it's designed for AI from the bottom up and that's exactly what Jensen showed off you're going to get situations where games will be designed to generate Worlds at least partially that come from a Blackwell chip and so the game won't work properly if it's not running on Blackwell because Blackwell will be what generates like 60% of the game graphics and so I think that's a brilliant play and it rein reinforces their EOS ecosystem number two Jensen got into how to think about the world as a world where Nvidia has both the hardware layer and also the layer above it which is the infrastructure layer the large language models prepared for uh Enterprise other models that enable Enterprise to operate two big releases there neotron and Cosmos so neotron is a fine-tuned llama based language model it comes in different flavors Nano super ultra for different Enterprise sizes really what what Jensen figured out is that Mark Zuckerberg can put a lot of money into building those language models but they have to be packaged in a way that enterprises can use and so Nvidia fine-tuned those llamas language models so that enterprises want to use them on the Nvidia chips and now Nvidia has a full solution get our chips get our language model we're done it's great thanks Mark Zuckerberg and then Cosmos is a world Foundation model that they built more from scratch it again it goes back to their gaming RS it can generate photorealistic environments for robotics for autonomous vehicle training Jensen is huge on the future of Robotics and autonomous vehicles and he wants to be the place where you train and build Robotics and so Cosmos is a place where you can actually generate these photorealistic environments and you can run your robots through those environments virtually and you can see how they're making decisions before they impact real world safety which is a big deal okay that brings me to three auton automotive and Robotics platforms so Thor is a Next Generation system on a chip it has 20x performance of Orin which was the previous version and really when you think about a system on a chip what matters there is that it aims to deliver everything from like driver assistant systems to autonomous vehicles like level three autonomy and also high-end robotics application it has 20x the processing capability of Orin so it can handle higher compute demands with high resolution sensors like cameras lar radar plus Advanced AI models it's meant to handle both in Cabin stuff like occupant monitoring and outof cabin stuff like path planning and it's meant to stack in again this is their ecosystem play with an entire operating system that sits on the Nvidia stack so Drive OS runs on Thor ships it's been certified to ASL which is the highest Automotive Safety level people are going to start to use this when they start to design autonomous driving Solutions maybe not Tesla but autonomous driving is rapidly commoditizing so it's going to happen now Omniverse plus Isaac plus Cosmos is sort of the same play but aimed more at robots and autonomous vehicles and Factory environments and so that's where you have an integrated Suite where you have the cosmos virtual environment you have the Omniverse for simulating particular spaces um and it all comes together in a way that enables a company to have a suite for training robots and deploying them in simulated environment so that they can be confident that they can deploy them in the real world using Nvidia architecture again and actually get something that matters so fundamentally Invidia wants to knit together Hardware software and data to remain the core AI platform all three of these plays show that whether it's mainstream desktop gpus AI Foundation models with neotron or Cosmos or robotics autonomous systems like Thor these moves are going to Define nvidia's strategy wherever AI happens to go over the next half decade it's a huge CES so there you go that's my takeaways from Jensen's Keynote",
