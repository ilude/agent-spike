  "raw_transcript": "They know their domain. They're not afraid to use it and deeply wrap it into AI. Number two, they have distribution. They have figured out how to build relationships in the book of business. And this sounds self-fulfilling, but I don't think it is. I think that distribution is one of those things that consultants are able to achieve when they are able to demonstrate disproportionate value even to one customer to start and they generate word of mouth and referral. So distribution does matter as a marker of authenticity and a marker of good work especially if you can maintain and grow that distribution in the age of AI. They are clearly differentiated clearly differentiated from other work and having your own domain helps with that but so does explaining how you engage differently. Otherwise, you're just going to wash into the background of the hundreds of thousands of other AI consultants.",

    "description": "My site: https://natebjones.com\nMy substack: https://natesnewsletter.substack.com/\nStory: https://natesnewsletter.substack.com/p/the-end-to-end-ai-client-value-playbook?r=1z4sm5\n\nTakeaways\n 1. Distribution Is King: Consultants who already own client relationships can scale fastest\u2014provided their AI advice is substantive, not surface-level.\n 2. Kill the AI-Wash: Buzzword-heavy pitches (\u201cAI-powered everything\u201d) destroy credibility; clients expect clear, technically sound answers like when RAG is appropriate.\n 3. Own a Specific Domain: Wrap AI around deep sector expertise\u2014much like a strangler fig\u2014so your niche authority and pricing power grow together.\n 4. Package With Living Templates: AI lets templates evolve in real time, making services sharply scoped yet highly customizable for each engagement.\n 5. Build a Trusted Network: No one covers the full value chain; cultivate specialist partners so you can bring the right \u201cJames\u201d to every project.\n 6. Publish to Prove Credibility: Sharing detailed, NDA-safe insights publicly separates you from the sea of generic \u201cAI consultants\u201d and fuels referrals.\n\nQuotes\n\u201cWe don\u2019t need more AI slogans; we need consultants who can answer, \u2018When should I use RAG\u2014and why?\u2019\u201d\n\u201cA strangler-fig strategy works: grow AI expertise around the trunk of the domain you already dominate.\u201d\n\u201cIf you AI-wash today, you don\u2019t just lose the deal\u2014you poison the whole ecosystem tomorrow.\u201d\n\nSummary\nI argue that great AI consultants win by combining genuine domain mastery with deep, specific AI fluency rather than vague \u201cAI-washing.\u201d Distribution still rules, so leverage an existing book of business or build one through clear, public content that showcases expertise. Focus on a narrow niche, articulate concrete deliverables, and back them with living, AI-enabled templates. Cultivate trusted partners for adjacent parts of the value chain and stay transparent to avoid poisoning the ecosystem with overhyped claims. When consultants pair granular knowledge with credible, outcome-oriented packages, they command higher fees and earn the long-term trust that keeps clients coming back.\n\nKeywords\nAI consulting, distribution, AI-washing, domain expertise, specificity, RAG, templates, partnerships, content marketing, trust, value chain, niche, client retention",
