  "raw_transcript": "This is the beginning of an entire new arc where we will see AI become more proactive. This is one of the first widely consumer available proactive AI experiences. And I want you to keep that in mind because a lot of the other threads we're following over the course of the last few months point to a 2026 that is more AI proactive versus AI reactive and major model makers are all building in that direction. Let's get to story number two. Microsoft is diversifying co-pilot with anthropic models. And this is really fascinating because Microsoft has been known for leaning in on OpenAI for a while. But as we discovered in the last couple weeks, Microsoft and OpenAI have finalized a new looser partnership format. And it's not super surprising in that context to see Microsoft go for another major model maker as essential to their suite of tools.",
