  "raw_transcript": "today is the day after open aai announced their new model 03 I want to call out five things that I don't think are widely understood about the model and I want to talk them through here the first one is the arc AGI prize which is a prize that was established for the first model to reach a practical artificial general intelligence State this model is so good 03 is so good they had to issue a special statement explaining why they are not going to award the prize to 03 and spoiler alert it's not because it's not smart enough the human Baseline on the current Arc AGI prize testing Suite is 85% and 03 hit 87 human equivalency and the reason why they're not awarding the prize is because they feel that 03 is too expensive to really be practical to employ which I think is fair it's running a ,000 $2,000 a pop that feels kind of pricey but it should call out how we've entered this weird moment right where we are now in the blurry beginnings of artificial general intelligence number two 03 mini is coming so what people don't realize is that when they launch a full model it becomes easier to distill inference down and get a faster quicker model that has most of the same capabilities and So based on early benchmarking it looks like 03 mini which will probably come out in January or February of this year is going to be vastly cheaper than 01 is right now better than 01 faster than 01 but of course not nearly as good as full 03 that's still plenty of intelligence for most applications you may well see 03 mini in cursor or wind surf or your development environment of choice in the first quarter so we need to start expecting that we will get this Tik Tock motion where you have a full cycle of intelligence breakthrough and then a distillation cycle that follows it that distills that inference down in a way that's not quite as good but is very very fast and much cheaper this brings me to number three I don't think people really understand how these inference time compute engines work and calling them an llm is a little bit deceptive at this point so at the end of the day they appear to be solving for deep thinking and deep reasoning with o03 the way the architecture of alpha go worked and if you don't know that story very briefly Alpha go was the computer program that beat go which is an ancient game that is very very difficult for humans to play well and that was considered harder than chess and effectively now it's been solved by Machine learning and the way they did it was they actually stuck a Monte Carlo simulation on top of multiple different uh engines that could run go so closing that example moving over to o03 and how it connects 03 is running multi Monte Carlo simulations across thousands of calls to large language models we think and that means that it can imagine multiple possible paths to the solution run them through these calls to the llms and then come back and pick the one that it feels has the highest probability and that's how it's doing insanely difficult mathematics problems and other things it's also why it takes a while and it's also why it's so expensive and I think that people think of an llm as sort of a monolithic entity like it's a one thing right it's a large language model but that it's like calling Amazon an e-commerce store right like it's it's an easy interface stretched over this gigantic Warehouse Network and insanely complex Tech in the same way 03 is like this simple interface stretched across this insane Patchwork together simulation thousands of calls LMS Etc and I think knowing how it works helps number four this is really really good at coding 03 is currently benchmarked as the number 175th best programmer in the world so is it better than every single programmer not yet is it better than 99.99% of us yes I would put myself at the bottom there right like I'm not good but like is it better than almost everybody who picks up code yes and by the Next Generation is it going to be number one quite possibly quite possibly okay this brings me to number five I do not think that everybody is going to lose their job for a very simple reason 98% of the world doesn't know about this and cultural change takes time so when the steam engine was invented it took 150 years to fully realize the impact of the steam engine across Society we may be much much faster with AI but even much much faster is way way slower than you're probably thinking right now I walked through an airport yesterday I guarantee you I was the one in the airport that was thinking the most about AI everybody else around me was acting like nothing had changed and I knew that 03 had been released I knew what the arc AGI scores were and nobody was paying any attention that is going to be the way it is and the people who understand Ai and what just happened were going to feel like a fish out of for a while it's going to be a very weird year so stick with me we'll figure it out together I'm working on some uh scaling laws and questions around AI that I think that we need to think about in the light of o03 and I'm going to put those into a longer substack so there you go cheers good luck with the weird future we all live in",

    "description": "About me: https://natebjones.com/\nMy links: https://linktr.ee/natebjones\no3 programmer: https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1hiqnuy/openai_o3_is_equivalent_to_the_175_best_human/\nAI steam engine: https://blog.workist.com/en/ai-new-steam-engine-intellectual-revolution\nARC-AGI: https://arcprize.org/arc\no3 Mini: https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/12/openai-announces-o3-and-o3-mini-its-next-simulated-reasoning-models/\n\nTakeaways:\n 1. Blurry Beginnings of AGI: o3 achieved an 87% score on the ARC AGI test, surpassing the human baseline of 85%. This milestone signals the early, imperfect stages of artificial general intelligence, though its high cost ($1,000-$2,000 per run) prevents practical use today.\n 2. o3 Mini\u2019s Upcoming Launch: A smaller, faster, and cheaper version of o3 is expected in early 2024. While less capable than the full o3 model, it will still outperform o1 and likely integrate into tools like Cursor and Windsurf, making AI accessible for broader applications.\n 3. Monte Carlo Simulations at Scale: o3 employs a Monte Carlo simulation framework, running thousands of LLM calls to evaluate multiple solution paths and select the most probable outcome. This complex system mirrors techniques used by AlphaGo to master the game of Go.\n 4. Programming Dominance: Benchmarking as the 175th best programmer globally, o3 outperforms 99.99% of human coders. Its next iteration may even claim the top global ranking, reshaping how developers approach complex software challenges.\n 5. Misconceptions About LLMs: o3 isn\u2019t a single, monolithic model. Instead, it\u2019s a sophisticated system with a simple interface layered over a complex network of simulations and LLM calls, akin to Amazon\u2019s vast logistics network behind its e-commerce platform.\n 6. Slow Societal Adoption: Despite technological breakthroughs, only a small percentage of people are aware of o3. Historical parallels like the 150-year societal adoption of the steam engine suggest AI\u2019s full impact will unfold gradually, though likely faster than past revolutions.\n 7. Scaling Law Insights: Future analysis of o3\u2019s scaling laws may provide key insights into optimizing its architecture, reducing costs, and accelerating its adoption across industries.\n\nQuotes:\n\u201cWe are now in the blurry beginnings of artificial general intelligence.\u201d\n\u201cCalling o3 a single LLM is like calling Amazon just an e-commerce store\u2014it\u2019s a simple interface over a highly complex system.\u201d\n\u201cEven the best breakthroughs take time to impact society; most people don\u2019t even know o3 exists yet.\u201d\n\nSummary:\nOpenAI\u2019s o3 represents a major leap toward AGI, scoring 87% on the ARC AGI test and outperforming human baselines. Its architecture employs Monte Carlo simulations to evaluate multiple solution paths, making it both powerful and expensive to run. The upcoming o3 Mini will offer a cheaper, faster alternative suitable for most applications, potentially integrating into tools like Cursor and Windsurf. o3\u2019s capabilities rival the top 0.01% of programmers globally, with its next iteration poised for the top spot. Despite these advancements, societal adoption will likely be slow, mirroring historical trends in technological revolutions.\n\nKeywords:\no3, ARC AGI Prize, artificial general intelligence, Monte Carlo simulations, AlphaGo, o3 Mini, Cursor, Windsurf, large language models, AI programming, scaling laws, steam engine adoption, OpenAI, AGI development, software automation, developer tools",
