  "raw_transcript": "so Jensen hang was up on stage at their big conference and video's big conference GTC I want to give you what I think are the most impactful things that he announced and we can we can argue about them but uh I think that they speak to where his priorities are at and I think that's what matters uh so first up they're continuing to evolve on chips that's the core of their business they announced the Reuben series which will come after Blackwell their second Blackwell uh iteration is going to come in the second half of this year and then they'll be on to Ruben next year and into 2027 uh take all of those timelines with a grain of salt they struggle to get Blackwell uh at appropriate yields in production last year so they're just rolling it out now chips are more magic than they are science in some ways so we'll we'll sort of see but apparently it's going to be the usual right cooler faster more memory the stuff that investors want to hear is what Jensen is delivering let's move to Applications he is pushing Robotics and he is pushing cars uh and I think that's really interesting the other thing he's pushing of course is their little sort of workstation that they're doing for on premise so if you're a developer you can run a local model I don't see that consuming a huge number of his chips I do think like the core chip series getting into server racks is obviously the heart of their business and then moving into household robotics he unveiled a little R2-D2 kind of a thing and then getting into cars um and I think it's a partnership with GM that he's working on those will be significant those will be drivers for the business long term the other one that seems speculative uh they're continuing to invest really heavily in the neotron models which is a fork of llama which is meta sort of core-based model uh I think Jensen claimed it was better than deep SE get supercharges agents blah blah blah great fine uh my question is how does it supercharge your business model how does having neotron help a customer stay in the Nvidia stack and I think that's of the really interesting questions because most Enterprise Stacks are inherently sort of multi-tenant and part of where Nvidia has won is by basically having the hardware heart of the stack locked down like you may be multi-tenant in other places you may have multiple models you may be a multic cloud Enterprise but you're still going to be on Nvidia Hardware a lot of the time I am curious if they're able to figure out the secret sauce to have that same kind of grip on Baseline llm driven operations and I think one of the ways they might do it is as AI application scale you're going to have different intelligence levels needed for different applications and you may have premier stuff that's fancy like research or whatever that you want to do with a Cutting Edge Chad GPT Model A Cutting Edge model from anthropic maybe who knows uh your your engineers probably will be using anthropic when they code sure but you're going to have because this is now the AI economy tons and tons and tons of little AI apps running and I wonder I just wonder if part of the pitch that jenssen is going to have his sales guys bring to Enterprise is you're going to have hundreds and thousands of applications that are small AI modules why not get something that is from Nvidia that is built to run agentically that has our own sort of reasoning attached to it that is designed to run effectively on Nvidia hardware and all of your basic household every day apps as an Enterprise can run on that kind of a stack and if you want fancy stuff over the top that's fine you can go grab another model it's just a guess but that would be the sales pitch I would make that would enable me to drive lock in from an Nvidia perspective which is kind of what they want is they want to kind of keep people in the ecosystem and a lot of how you read the conference is basically how does it reinforce their business model so those are the things I think that are standing out to me we can obviously go farther in Jensen continues to love leather jackets and I know that's what you were worried about um and he apparently was using a T-shirt cannon so pretty standard sort of how do I put it pretty standard Shenanigans for a conference uh I will continue to keep you posted through the week as we uh move forward but I figure robot cars R2D2 getting some new Chips these These are pretty decent keynote startups for or ke keynote starters for the first day of the conference cheers",
