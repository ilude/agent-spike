I can roll it out as a manager to my sales team or my engineering team or my product team and I'm done and we can move on and it's just it's a oneanddone thing. AI is on an exponential curve. This is a case of getting onto a moving train. You are either going to lean all the way in and you are going to learn fast and you are going to scale up quickly in your skills and keep leaning in or you're going to get left behind. And if you learn two or three lines in a prompt and you think you've got it, you're in the left behind contingent.",
