  "raw_transcript": "at 10:00 a.m. today December 20th open AI closed their 12 days of open aai ship Miss by releasing the 03 model to a very very very tiny group of researchers you are not going to get it I am not going to get it this is for safety researchers only and you have to apply and you have to be cleared the reason for that is that they are going to be releasing this to the public in the next year they say in January for the Mini version and then after that for the the full version of 03 but they need to complete red teaming they need to complete safety work first and that safety work has only become more important as the model has become more capable in fact open AI said they had to Pioneer a new kind of alignment testing and safety work just for the 03 model because it's so capable and that brings me to sort of the big headline here 03 according to the people who have played with it and tested it is approaching general intelligence and we should start to think about where we want to use it and apply it if it is indeed going to be an autonomous system capable of doing most economically valuable work more effectively than humans which is the the rough rule that uh open AI keeps for what artificial general intelligence means the trick is it's not cheap so even as we think about what to do with it we have to think about what we're willing to spend on it and I think that for those of us who are listening to this and saying well there goes my job it's not exactly that clear I looked at a graph displaying the costs of running heavy compute tasks appropriate for 03 in the arc AGI test suite and I'll link The Arc AGI test report for 03 here it is over ,000 per task and I want to ask you are you you ready to pay $1,000 for an answer from chat GPT I not very many of us are are you ready to are you ready to pay $100 for an answer from 03 mini that's the cost that 03 mini was running not very many of us are and so the reason I call that out is because we are going to live in a world in 2025 where intelligence is not a bottleneck anymore and instead we have to think about how to apply the correct level of intelligence for the task that we want to accomplish and 99% of the time it is going to be less intelligence than the maximum available and we will bring in 03 as a society when we really need to solve a hard problem like if we want to solve something that a PhD can't effectively solve that's fine we would bring in 03 for that but in most cases for most of our work we wouldn't need it and we would have plenty of cheap capable intelligent models and so we've been in this Rush since 2022 of getting more and more intelligent models and sort of being in awe of how well they do at mimicking human language and intelligence and calling out their shortcomings that's been the story the story in the years to come is going to be we don't actually know all the capabilities of these systems sometimes their intelligence outstrips us we use them for specific applications and for most of us intelligence is just like the air we breathe it's no longer a bottleneck we can have all the intelligence we need at our fingertips it's just about getting the right intelligence into place that is a massive change uh and it's going to take a long time for us to figure out what it means and 2025 is the year we're going to start to do that so 03 is here and we're all going to find out what that means uh when it starts to come out next year cheers",

    "description": "About me: https://natebjones.com/\nMy links: https://linktr.ee/natebjones\nAI - AGI: https://x.com/fchollet/status/1870169764762710376\no3 model: https://openai.com/index/early-access-for-safety-testing/\no3 news: https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/openai-unveils-o3-reasoning-ai-models-test-phase-2024-12-20/\n\nChapters:\n00:01 - OpenAI\u2019s O3 Model Release\n01:15 - Limited Access and Safety Testing\n02:30 - O3\u2019s General Intelligence Potential\n03:50 - Cost Structure and Use Cases\n05:10 - Intelligence as a Utility in 2025\n07:00 - Future Implications of O3\n\nTakeaways:\n 1. O3 Model Released: OpenAI unveiled its O3 model, restricted initially to safety researchers to ensure robust testing before broader public access.\n 2. Alignment Testing Innovation: O3\u2019s capabilities required OpenAI to develop entirely new safety and alignment testing protocols, reflecting its unprecedented potential.\n 3. Public Release Timeline: O3 Mini launches in January 2024, with the full version to follow later in the year, pending safety work completion.\n 4. Cost Structure Highlights: The full O3 model costs over $1,000 per compute-heavy task, while O3 Mini is priced at $100 per task, limiting its use to high-value applications.\n 5. Approaching AGI: Early testers suggest O3 may meet OpenAI\u2019s definition of AGI, capable of outperforming humans in most economically valuable tasks.\n 6. Intelligence as a Utility: By 2025, intelligence will no longer be the bottleneck; the focus will shift to strategically deploying the right level of intelligence for each task.\n 7. Strategic Applications: O3 will likely be reserved for specialized, complex problems, as more affordable, capable models handle routine tasks.\n\nQuotes:\n\u201cWe\u2019re entering a world where intelligence is no longer a bottleneck\u2014it\u2019s about applying the right level of intelligence to the task.\u201d\n\u201cO3 is pushing us closer to general intelligence, capable of outperforming humans in most economically valuable tasks.\u201d\n\u201cBy 2025, intelligence will be abundant; the challenge will be figuring out how to use it wisely.\u201d\n\nSummary:\nAt 10 a.m. on December 20th, OpenAI announced its O3 model, marking a significant step toward AGI. Initially available only to safety researchers, O3 introduces groundbreaking capabilities requiring new alignment protocols. Public access begins in January 2024 with O3 Mini, while the full version follows later. With costs over $1,000 per task, O3 is designed for specialized, high-value problems. OpenAI projects that by 2025, intelligence will be an abundant resource, shifting focus from creating smarter systems to applying intelligence strategically. This marks a pivotal moment in how we use AI in daily life and complex challenges.\n\nKeywords:\nOpenAI, O3, AGI, artificial general intelligence, alignment testing, safety protocols, intelligence as a utility, compute costs, AI strategy, O3 Mini, red-teaming, 2025, PhD-level tasks, AI advancements, strategic intelligence deployment.",
