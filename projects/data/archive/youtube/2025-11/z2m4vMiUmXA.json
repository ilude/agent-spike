  "raw_transcript": "I got my start in a job that AI has changed dramatically already, right? I was doing nonprofit grant management. AI can do a lot of the work that I was doing at the push of a button. Then I went over to Oracle eyes store management and conversion optimization. Conversion optimization doesn't exist as a job anymore. AI took it away. And eyes store I mean who has Oracle eyes store anymore? I'm sure there someone's going to come up and say I have Oracle eyesore after this but most people don't. And then I went and did marketing and I looked at marketing attribution systems. Again, another area where AI has taken a lot of the work away. I looked at voice of customer, almost totally automated by AI now. And what's funny as I say all of those things is that even though AI has made huge strides, we still have people who are grant fund managers.",
