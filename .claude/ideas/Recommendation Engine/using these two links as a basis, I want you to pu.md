# using these two links as a basis, I want you to put together a list of research and reference material for building an AI preference engine, that understand my likes and dislikes and when given new content can make an estimate of how much I would like to consume that content, as well as tag that content in both a tag cloud as well as a hierarchical tree, going from general topics to specifics. And Finally I want it to be able to generate search queries for the web to find content that I would like based on the data it collects into these data structures.

Do you have any questions for me before we begin?

To begin building an AI preference engine with advanced tagging and search capabilities, the following list covers essential research and reference material based on the provided links and recent literature:

### Foundational Links

- The Second-Me GitHub repository contains practical code and documentation for implementing digital personas, including methods for modeling user preferences, semantic tagging, and decision reasoning.[^1]
- The arXiv paper's bibliography offers a curated list of academic works on intent modeling, preference learning, and content recommendation frameworks.[^1]


### Key Literature and Case Studies

- A comprehensive review of AI-powered recommendation engines highlights the evolution from traditional collaborative filtering to sophisticated neural networks, hybrid systems, real-time contextual modeling, and ethical considerations like transparency and fairness.[^4][^7]
- Stanford's IS-Rec framework focuses on inferring users’ intent and real-time preferences, emphasizing the accuracy and transparency of recommendations by modeling human intent.[^3]
- Industry case studies show the economic and experiential impact of AI-driven recommendations on sales and customer satisfaction, illustrating practical system architectures and performance metrics.[^6]


### Methods for Predicting Preference and Rating New Content

- Foundational algorithms for estimating preference include k-nearest neighbors, Bayesian networks, decision trees, and deep neural networks, each of which is suited to different data volumes and structures.[^2][^4]
- Hybridization strategies combine collaborative and content-based filtering, often using ensemble, switching, cascade, and feature-augmentation techniques to optimize recommendations based on the user’s available data.[^4]


### Tag Cloud and Hierarchical Topic Modeling References

- Semantic tagging utilizes structured tagging schemes (tag clouds) and unsupervised machine learning (topic modeling, clustering) to describe content from general to specific, supporting both cloud-based and hierarchical tree data structures.[^2][^4]
- Hierarchical tree construction can be accomplished using taxonomic methods, topical neural embedding, or recursive clustering of tags extracted from content.[^4]


### Search Query Generation

- Methods for query generation combine intent inference, topic classification, and preference-weighted tag selection to automate the discovery of new content.[^3][^4]
- Generative AI models (such as transformer-based architectures) can be fine-tuned to create natural language queries that reflect user preferences and tag-based structures.[^8]


### Tools and Platforms

- Weka, Orange, and RapidMiner: User-friendly platforms for experimenting with various machine learning algorithms on preference prediction and recommendation tasks.[^2]
- Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch: Libraries to develop custom models for ranking and tagging content using both classical and deep learning techniques.[^4]
